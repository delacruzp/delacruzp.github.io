                    review: `I was laughing out loud throughout this entire movie. The only moments when I was not laughing, it was because I was aggressively sobbing.

I must admit I was apprehensive going into this movie. But everything about it was SO f-ing good. Every single joke landed, and my entire movie theater was enjoying the movie, which made the whole experience all the more enjoyable.

I think it's my first time watching a movie where the relationship with the parents is not a zero-sum game. It's not all in nor all out. It's hard, complicated, awkward, and at times sad, and still they keep trying to make it work.

I loved splitting the movie into chapters. Love the way it tells the stories. Both the cutaways from the date to the discussion of the date and back. The sister narration. Ugh, I love this movie.

Scenes where I cried:
• Naveen saying that of course he wants a wedding and love, and all the nice things.
• The mom saying that she was scared to say the wrong thing and lose her kid forever.
• The dad saying that his kid has good taste.`,

Granted, my expectations going into it were on the floor, but hey, apparently that's the key to loving a movie.

Things I loved:
• The cinematography
• The shot of them sitting by the beach, with the afro backlit and glowing like a halo.
• The shot of the snow falling through the window.
• The jokes
• My dad is divorced.
• Are you safe in your home? Yes. I have a cat.
• I'm gay, who would have guessed?
Honestly, too many to list, which is why I loved this.
• The plot
• The sandwich scene.
• The doctor asking questions without a tonal shift.
• The baby scene.
• The acting

Dude. I just loved this movie. Bye.` },

                    review: `A difficult read, worth the effort, like all best things.

I forgot how much I love a well-thought-out story. A perfect ending is one of the few joys of life.

This book pushed me in more ways than one. I got to learn about the Sri Lankan civil war, the racial conflicts on the other side of the world, names that my tongue struggles to pronounce, and stories that, although new, brought up familiar emotions.

At the end of the day, the world keeps spinning, our efforts have a limited impact, and our actions hurt our loved ones, but life is definitely not nothing.

New Word:
- Frock

Quotes that made me smile:
- That woman has children to feed. That man has a hospital to run. You take photos; how impressive.
- His head is not between his shoulders, as heads prefer to be.
- I'm not your helper, sir. I only help those that help me... -- You sound like the UN.
- Usually when you brought women home, which was about as frequent as free and fair elections...

Favorite Paragraphs:
- "Once you have seen your own face and recognized the color of your eyes, tasted the air and smelled the soil, drunk from the purest fountains and the dirtiest wells, that is the kindest thing you can say about life: it's not nothing."
- "And right then with the moon in the sky, you realize you have nothing left to tell and no one to tell it to. You recognize this as a simple fact and are neither dismayed nor gladdened."
