                    review: `I was laughing out loud through out this entire movie. The only moments when I was not laughing it was, because I was aggressively sobbing.

I must admit I was apprehensive going into this movie. But everything about it was SO f-ing good. Every single joke landed, my entire movie theater was enjoying the movie, which made the whole experience that more enjoyable.

I think it's my first time watching a movie, where the relationship with the parents it's not a zero sum game. It's not all in, neither all out. It's hard, complicated, awkward and at time sad, and still they keep trying to make it work.

I loved the splitting the movie into chapters. Love the way it tell the stories. Both the cutaways from the date, to the discussion of the date, and back. The sister narration. Ugh I love this movie.

Scenes where I cried:
• Naveen saying that of course he wants a wedding and love, and all the nice things.
• The mom saying that she was scared to say the wrong thing, and lose her kid forever.
• The dad saying that his kid has good taste.`,

Granted my expectations going into it where on the floor, but hey apparently that's the key to loving a movie.

Things I loved:
• The cinematography
• The shot of them seating by the beach, with the afro backlit, and glowing like a halo.
• The shot of the snow falling thorugh the window.
• The Jokes
• My dad is divorced.
• Are you safe, in your home? Yes. I have a cat.
• I'm gay, who would have guessed?
Honestly, too many to list. Which is why I loved this.
• The Plot
• The sandwich scene.
• The doctor asking questions without a tonal shift.
• The baby scene.
• The Acting

Dude. I just loved this movie. Bye.` },

                    review: `A difficult read, worth the effort, like all best things.

I forgot how much I love a well thought-out story. A perfect ending is one of the few joys of life.

This booked pushed me, in more ways than one. I got to learned about the Sri Lanka civil war, the racial conflicts in the other side of the world, names that my tongue struggles to pronounced and stories that although noveled, brought up familiar emotions.

At the end of the day, the world keeps spinning, our efforts have a limited impact, our actions hurt our loved ones, but life is definitely not nothing.
