    "synopsis": ".SYNOPSIS...  A warming trend this weekend with continued dry weather. A storm system will bring the potential for heavy rain and strong coastal winds late Monday night into Tuesday, but there is a risk of some wintry mix/ice across the interior late Monday into Tue morning. Blustery, dry and seasonably cold weather follows Wednesday through Friday.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL MIDNIGHT TONIGHT/...  4 pm update...  Wave clouds filling back in. Low level moisture which has remained trapped beneath a stout dry inversion around H9 continues to advect S/E with the light steering current. Locations mainly N of the MA- pike have found themselves underneath a blanket while folks to the S have seen a day of abundant sunshine. Yet overall highs over much of S New England have warmed up around the low 30s, some locations around 35 degrees.  Expecting low clouds to linger as temperatures drop towards midnight. Watching the clearing line out of Upstate NY as warmer, drier air begins to push in out of the W/SW, increasing which is discussed in much further detail below. Temperatures are anticipated to stabilize, slightly warming in some spots. Looking at temperatures to drop towards nighttime lows around the mid to upper 20s.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...  Through Saturday...  Digging N-stream energy out of the Arctic reaches of Canada, capturing and stretching energy out of a sweeping H5 trof axis into the W CONUS, parent surface low continues to deepen across the N Great Lakes region into the St. Lawrence River Valley down to around 990 mb up against high pressure over the SE CONUS up to 1030 mb. A tightening pressure gradient emerges along with a subsequent jet streak, a gradient wind threat exists around the Saturday morning timeframe.  H925 westerly winds 45 to 55 mph, the height of which is around Saturday morning. Accompanying stout inversion, strengthening, with pronounced warming through the H8-9 layer. Limitations on the potential mix down of faster momentum to the surface, however, if the boundary layer is able to mix up to H95 / 1200 feet agl, then there is the possibility of getting wind gusts up around 40 to 45 mph.  However, considering the cold, icy ocean, and snow pack ground, expect outcomes to mainly be gradient driven with gusts on the order of +5 to the sustained wind. Sustained around 30 mph, gusts around 35 mph possible along the S-coast, Cape and Islands, but again, colder conditions right at the surface are likely to limit mixing.  Warm air advection proceeding aloft along with abundant sunshine, temperatures warming towards the low 50s through the day as the height of the winds aloft pass through, it is only then that gusts 20 to 30 mph are possible across much of S New England aside from the faster winds along the S/SE coast, both of which diminish towards sundown.  GALE WARNINGS for the waters but no WIND ADVISORY headlines given such a marginal event. If any one location has the best chance of seeing wind advisory criteria with sustained winds over 30 mph it would be Nantucket.  Saturday night...  Main surface cold front pushing S into the region, eroding beneath high pressure. Light winds expected with filtering mid to high level clouds across the region within the zonal pressure gradient aloft. Stout inversion building across the region down to H95, with higher dewpoint air lingering along with the likely boundary layer mixing of snowmelt and now cold air advection proceeding, expecting to seeing low clouds develop towards Sunday morning. Keeping it mild with lows around the upper 20s to low 30s for the timeframe.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...  Highlights...  * Dry and mild Sunday along with light winds * Risk of a wintry mix/ice western MA late Mon into Tue morning * A period of heavy rain and strong coastal winds likely late Mon   night into Tue * Dry, Seasonably cold Wed/Thu & Friday  Synoptic Overview...  Winter break? It looks that way given the lack of high latitude blocking combined with subtropical ridge emerging over FL from time to time will result in a fast/progressive northern stream jet of modest amplitude across the CONUS. Thus temperatures likely running at or slightly above normal the next 7-10 days. In addition given the progressive nature of the northern stream and streams appearing to be unphased, excessive precip events appear unlikely.  Sunday...  Dry/quiet weather with confluent mid level flow over the region providing plenty of subsidence. Thus sunshine, light winds and a mild airmass will support highs in the mid to upper 40s. Leaned toward the milder EC MOS here. It will feel even milder given the light winds and full sunshine. Not too shabby for Jan 21st.  Monday...  Turning colder as 1038 mb high over southern James Bay advects into southern Quebec with cold air bleeding southward into New England. This will set the stage for a wintry precip event for interior southern New England as warm advection from an approaching closed low rides up and over a cold dome spreading southward. Monday will begin dry but the GFS and its ensembles (GEFS) have precip overspreading the region during the afternoon. New 12z EC now introduces some light qpf late in the day across CT, west-central MA. We will lean toward a model blend which brings chance pops across the area Mon aftn. EC more amplified/colder solution than GFS/GEFS with high probability of mixed precip and ice across the interior Mon ngt into Tue morning. EC ensembles support the operational run with 50% probability of 32 degs or colder Mon ngt all the way to the CT/MA border. Thus will hedge the forecast toward this colder scenario especially given the cold air damming (CAD) signature with 1038 mb high over Quebec. Could be some impact here given it doesn`t take much ice to cause problems.  Tuesday...  How quickly shallow cold air scours out will hinge on timing and location of triple pt low development. If triple pt low tracks directly over the region (along with pres falls) shallow cold air would likely linger across northwest MA much of the day per EC and its ensembles (ECENS). Thus will have to watch this evolution closely as could be an extended period of freezing rain into Tue across northwest MA.  Otherwise warm sector likely overspreads RI and at least southeast MA with temps surging into the 50s. More importantly will be a subtropical plume of moisture advecting up the eastern seaboard ahead of an approaching cold front with PWATs +2SD. Also strong southerly wind anomalies of up to +2SD within this moisture plume providing periods of heavy windswept rain. Also could be some embedded elevated convective elements as mid level lapse rates near moist adiabatic. Deterministic guidance has qpf ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 inches which is supported by both GEFS and ECENS ensembles with modest probs of 1 inch potential. System remains progressive which will limit excessive rainfall potential.  As previous shifts have mentioned strong low level southerly jet of 65-70 kt at 925 mb crosses the region Tue, yielding a wind swept rain along with the risk of stronger winds aloft reaching the surface especially in heavier shower/convective activity and in the warm sector (coastal plain).  As for impacts to river ice with potential rainfall near an inch next Tue, given dew pts remain at or below 32 degs much of the time leading up to Tue and then only briefly warming to 45-50 Tue aftn followed by dew pts falling back into the teens and 20s after Tue rainfall, not anticipating much melting, thus little impact to river ice.  Wednesday, Thursday and Friday...  Behind the departing Tue storm system it turns colder but seasonably cool with temperature anomalies at 850 and 925 mb very close to normal for late Jan. Mainly dry weather expected as well mid to late next week.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/... 5 PM update...  WINTER HEADLINES TONIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING...  Winter Storm Warnings have been expanded to include western Hampshire County along the slopes of the Berkshires and much of northern Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts. Otherwise, the warning area remains unchanged for the rest of northwestern Massachusetts. A Winter Weather Advisory remains in effect for northern CT, northwest RI, the region from near Springfield, MA to Worcester MA to just west of Boston.  WIND HEADLINES FOR MONDAY...  The High Wind Warning has been expanded to include all of south coastal RI, including Block Island, and all of southeast coastal Massachusetts including southern Bristol and southern and eastern Plymouth Counties. The High Wind Warning remains in effect for Cape Cod and the Islands. A Wind Advisory is in effect for the remainder of the forecast area.  Weak low pressure was moving through the Ohio Valley early this evening in association with a very strong short wave over Illinois. A secondary low pressure area was beginning to develop along the North Carolina coast. This system will phase with the upper support moving in from the west and lead to rapid intensification of the coastal storm on Monday, aided by a 150-160 kt jet at 300 mb. The low will be near or just east of Nantucket early Monday morning then rapidly deepen in the Gulf of Maine during the day on Monday.  Cloudiness will be lowering and thickening across our region this evening and precipitation will begin breaking out by midnight. Thermal profiles support snow in the northwest half of the region and a mix of rain and snow from Boston to Providence at the start, with rain along the coast. However, warmer air on increasing easterly winds, should change mixed precipitation to rain from northeast CT to Boston and points southeastward overnight. There could be an area of freezing rain and sleet from northern CT to southern Worcester County, northeastward into central Middlesex County. There could also be freezing rain and sleet in portions of northwest RI and Norfolk County, MA.  Snow is expected in northwest MA and north central MA for most of the storm. The snow may be moderate to heavy at times. Total snow accumulations are expected to reach 4 to 7 inches in the Warning area, with a localized 8 inch amount possible nearest to the Vermont and New Hampshire borders. Where there is mixed precipitation, only 2 to 4 inches is expected. And in Boston and Providence we are expecting anywhere from a coating to as much as 1 or 2 inches.  Have blended high resolution temperature guidance to arrive at minimums for tonight...ranging from mid and upper 20s northwest and central sections to the mid and upper 30s in coastal MA and southern RI, helped by winds off the water.",

On the tail end of the storm, we are expecting a line of convective snow showers, possibly even accompanied by a rumble of thunder, to cross the region between 6 AM and 10 AM. This is indicated on multiple high resolution models. The atmosphere will be unstable with Total Totals indices of 50 and negative Equivalent Potential Vorticity. This narrow band could produce heavy snowfall rates...and could potentially be moving through Hartford/Springfield at 6-7 AM, Worcester at 8-9 AM, and Boston and points north from 9-10 AM.  A very strong low level jet will develop with mainly westerly winds in the wake of the low. Cold advection mixing will be occurring all the way to 800 mb or higher up in the atmosphere. This should result in winds gusting to 40 to 60 mph, with gusts to 65 mph even possible over Cape Cod and the Islands. There will likely be a lot of power outages, both in southeast areas where the winds are strongest and in northern and western areas where fresh snow and any additional ice will cling to some lines.

Forecast highs are a few degrees colder for each location.  Subzero temperatures are forecast across parts of interior SNE Wednesday night/Thursday morning and again Thursday night/Friday morning. Wind chills may reach 15 below zero, which may eventually require Wind Chill Advisories. Area of greatest concern is near east slopes of Berkshires and in north central MA.  We are watching the potential for snow late in week as southern stream short wave develops low pressure off East Coast. Expect to see run-to-run variations among models over next few days as they struggle with timing issues of energy rounding base of upper trough, so it will probably be another couple of days at least until we begin to see some agreement.

Low center over SE New England, quick moving, associated with rapid cyclogenesis beneath a sharp negatively tilted H5 trof and associated potent vortmax, bombing out and closing low further downstream. Snow over the N/W interior, a wintry mix along the coastal plain, rain along the coast and over SE New England. Advisory level event with warning-level snows over NW MA. Threats and impacts tonight through Monday afternoon with snows, through Monday night with winds.  Complexity of mid-level disturbances, the potency of the N-stream and associated cyclonic tilt / amplitude, as to what merit is has to the S-stream, as to draw in or kick out ahead. Implications upon the strength of the system, the magnitude of synoptic and convergent forcing / lift. But a measure of uncertainty given several red flags with this system. All else considered as being equal among the forecast guidance, what stands out is the most is the following ...  1.) Warm temperatures and a rain / snow line further W across the interior. Surface low center sweeping over SE New England with the parent H85 low across the interior and the H7 low not closing off until over N NH / ME. Plenty of indications that warmer low to mid level air will wrap back to the W (around H8). Absent that cold air damming profile despite indications of ageostropic-isallobaric cold air drainage, mid-level wrap around and  dynamic cooling occurring later with the closing low, barely making it to the N MA border as the system quickly exits downstream. Profiles near isothermal up to H7 with a warm nose around H8. Challenges with precip-type, possible sleet and freezing rain mixing in. As noted yesterday, the mix line looks to set up around the I-495 / I-90 / I-84 NE to SW corridor. Wiggle room / uncertainty on the order of 10s of miles, the corridor down into Hartford on the cusp of potential headlines.  2.) Weak lift through the dendritic growth zone. Broadscale ascent across S New England out ahead of the H5 negatively tilted trof, the surface to mid-level warm front lifting N. Isentropic lift through the 280-300K surfaces, a measure of frontogenesis. But mainly within the low-levels, weak through the dendritic growth zone. Better QG- forcing and deep layer ascent manifest over N/W MA and CT on up into N New England as the system closes off, trowaling and deformation sharpening through the dendritic growth zone, frontogenetical SW-NE banding emerging, likely aided by orographic lift along the higher terrain. Perhaps a fly in the ointment is steep H8-6 lapse rates, a measure of instability (possible upright convection). But altogether same thinking as yesterday with initial forcing is within the low levels from 6z-12z Monday over all of S New England, more potent within the dendritic growth zone 12-18z as the wrap- around comma- head begins to emerge over N/W areas of MA especially, potentially into CT.  3.) Surging dry air though the dendritic / snow growth zone. A big take away is the absence of deep layer moisture. Can`t rule out that with pronounced E onshore flow that you can get ice nuclei down to around -8C, but it`s still concerning to see such pronounced mid- level drying, keeping the N stream wave separate from the S-stream plume along the offshore baroclinic zone, a S-stream which phases more so downstream as the system closes off and deepens.  SNOW/ICE...  Trimmed back snowfall amounts towards the I-495 / I-90 / I-84 corridor. Given red flags noted above, there just seems to be a lot of warm air that is going to erode the potential for areas to see more snow, and climatologically, given the track of the low and associated low-mid level features, this system is not a major snow producer for all of S New England. In agreement with surrounding offices and WPC, made the following decisions ...  WINTER STORM WARNINGS for Northwest MA with snowfall amounts exceeding 6 inches.  WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES from Northeast MA including Central and Western along the I-90 corridor, as well as all of Northern CT and Northwest RI. While closer to the warnings a general 2-5 inch event is forecast, the advisory was expanded east to encompass the threat of freezing rain and trace of ice.  Impacts late tonight and through Monday morning. Concern that with snow adhering to iced trees that there could be issues of down tree and tree limbs resulting in power outages. More so with increasing winds ... more on that below.  WIND...  Impressive pressure couplet given rapid cyclogenesis over the Gulf of ME. Pressure falls of 3-4 mb/hr followed by rises of 2-3 mb/hr, the isallobaric wind response is going to be wicked fast. Per BUFKIT soundings both the NAM and GFS remain consistent with the average wind within the layer over Nantucket around noon time Monday of 60 to 70 mph! Model forecast consensus has the pressure couplet, SREF mean has 10m sustained winds of 40 mph, GEFS mean over 45 mph, both having increased over prior model runs. Steep lapse rates up to H6.  HIGH WIND WARNINGS are valid the Cape and Islands as SW winds race into the low center deepening across the Gulf of Maine. Impacts centered around Monday morning.  WIND ADVISORIES over the rest of S New England. System continually deepening, winds turning W with cold air advection proceeding, lapse rates steepening all the way up to H6. Even if some areas don`t meet criteria when all is said and done, potential of downed tree / tree limbs especially if they`re still iced from the Friday into Saturday event becoming adhered by snow, obtaining weight, poses a threat to both life and property warranting the advisory. Impacts centered around midday into afternoon Monday.",

A fast moving developing coastal low will bring accumulating snow to the region mainly northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor late Sunday night into Christmas morning, but mainly rain expected along and southeast of that region.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  330 am update...  Quiet, dry day on tap before some Christmas day snows. Weak high pressure building in allowing for light winds. Should cloud decks remain more scattered to broken, for areas void of ice and snow expect temperatures to over-achieve into the low 40s. For late December, temperatures overall close to seasonable.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM MONDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - Snow expected mainly N/W of the I-495 / I-90 / I-84 corridor  - Accumulations generally around 2 to 5 inches, heaviest NW MA  - Possible trace of ice with sleet / freezing rain mixed in  - Strong to damaging westerly winds across all of S New England  - Strongest gusts over Cape and Islands with gusts over 60 mph  */ Discussion...  Low center over SE New England, quick moving, associated with rapid cyclogenesis beneath a sharp negatively tilted H5 trof and associated potent vortmax, bombing out and closing low further downstream. Snow over the N/W interior, a wintry mix along the coastal plain, rain along the coast and over SE New England. Advisory level event with warning-level snows over NW MA. Threats and impacts tonight through Monday afternoon with snows, through Monday night with winds.  Complexity of mid-level disturbances, the potency of the N-stream and associated cyclonic tilt / amplitude, as to what merit is has to the S-stream, as to draw in or kick out ahead. Implications upon the strength of the system, the magnitude of synoptic and convergent forcing / lift. But a measure of uncertainty given several red flags with this system. All else considered as being equal among the forecast guidance, what stands out is the most is the following ...  1.) Warm temperatures and a rain / snow line further W across the interior. Surface low center sweeping over SE New England with the parent H85 low across the interior and the H7 low not closing off until over N NH / ME. Plenty of indications that warmer low to mid level air will wrap back to the W (around H8). Absent that cold air damming profile despite indications of ageostropic-isallobaric cold air drainage, mid-level wrap around and  dynamic cooling occurring later with the closing low, barely making it to the N MA border as the system quickly exits downstream. Profiles near isothermal up to H7 with a warm nose around H8. Challenges with precip-type, possible sleet and freezing rain mixing in. As noted yesterday, the mix line looks to set up around the I-495 / I-90 / I-84 NE to SW corridor. Wiggle room / uncertainty on the order of 10s of miles, the corridor down into Hartford on the cusp of potential headlines.  2.) Weak lift through the dendritic growth zone. Broadscale ascent across S New England out ahead of the H5 negatively tilted trof, the surface to mid-level warm front lifting N. Isentropic lift through the 280-300K surfaces, a measure of frontogenesis. But mainly within the low-levels, weak through the dendritic growth zone. Better QG- forcing and deep layer ascent manifest over N/W MA and CT on up into N New England as the system closes off, trowaling and deformation sharpening through the dendritic growth zone, frontogenetical SW-NE banding emerging, likely aided by orographic lift along the higher terrain. Perhaps a fly in the ointment is steep H8-6 lapse rates, a measure of instability (possible upright convection). But altogether same thinking as yesterday with initial forcing is within the low levels from 6z-12z Monday over all of S New England, more potent within the dendritic growth zone 12-18z as the wrap- around comma- head begins to emerge over N/W areas of MA especially, potentially into CT.  3.) Surging dry air though the dendritic / snow growth zone. A big take away is the absence of deep layer moisture. Can`t rule out that with pronounced E onshore flow that you can get ice nuclei down to around -8C, but it`s still concerning to see such pronounced mid- level drying, keeping the N stream wave separate from the S-stream plume along the offshore baroclinic zone, a S-stream which phases more so downstream as the system closes off and deepens.  SNOW/ICE...  Trimmed back snowfall amounts towards the I-495 / I-90 / I-84 corridor. Given red flags noted above, there just seems to be a lot of warm air that is going to erode the potential for areas to see more snow, and climatologically, given the track of the low and associated low-mid level features, this system is not a major snow producer for all of S New England. In agreement with surrounding offices and WPC, made the following decisions ...  WINTER STORM WARNINGS for Northwest MA with snowfall amounts exceeding 6 inches.  WINTER STORM ADVISORIES from Northeast MA including Central and Western along the I-90 corridor, as well as all of Northern CT and Northwest RI. While closer to the warnings a general 2-5 inch event is forecast, the advisory was expanded east to encompass the threat of freezing rain and trace of ice.  Impacts late tonight and through Monday morning. Concern that with snow adhering to iced trees that there could be issues of down tree and tree limbs resulting in power outages. More so with increasing winds ... more on that below.  WIND...  Impressive pressure couplet given rapid cyclogenesis over the Gulf of ME. Pressure falls of 3-4 mb/hr followed by rises of 2-3 mb/hr, the isallobaric wind response is going to be wicked fast. Per BUFKIT soundings both the NAM and GFS remain consistent with the average wind within the layer over Nantucket around noon time Monday of 60 to 70 mph! Model forecast consensus has the pressure couplet, SREF mean has 10m sustained winds of 40 mph, GEFS mean over 45 mph, both having increased over prior model runs. Steep lapse rates up to H6.  HIGH WIND WARNINGS are valid the Cape and Islands as SW winds race into the low center deepening across the Gulf of Maine. Impacts centered around Monday morning.  WIND ADVISORIES over the rest of S New England. System continually deepening, winds turning W with cold air advection proceeding, lapse rates steepening all the way up to H6. Even if some areas don`t meet criteria when all is said and done, potential of downed tree / tree limbs especially if they`re still iced from the Friday into Saturday event becoming adhered by snow, obtaining weight, poses a threat to both life and property warranting the advisory. Impacts centered around midday into afternoon Monday.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...   * Arctic air dominates.  * Snow possible later Fri and Sat.  Fairly high confidence in overall pattern this week as broad cyclonic flow dominates with upper low remaining parked over south central Canada. Series of short waves rounding trough will bring reinforcements of arctic air, but moisture looks to be limited so dry weather is expected for much of week.  While record lows look to be out of reach, we may be challenging record cold high temperatures on Thu 12/28 which include 21 degrees at PVD in 1976, 18 degrees at BOS and BDL in 1924, and 15 degrees at ORH in 1976. Forecast highs are a few degrees colder for each location.  Subzero temperatures are forecast across parts of interior SNE Wednesday night/Thursday morning and again Thursday night/Friday morning. Wind chills may reach 15 below zero, which may eventually require Wind Chill Advisories. Area of greatest concern is near east slopes of Berkshires and in north central MA.  We are watching the potential for snow late in week as southern stream short wave develops low pressure off East Coast. Expect to see run-to-run variations among models over next few days as they struggle with timing issues of energy rounding base of upper trough, so it will probably be another couple of days at least until we begin to see some agreement. In meantime, ensemble probabilities show greater potential for snow later Friday and especially Saturday.",

Winds will be rather light...so a comfortable day for late December standards.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...  Highlights...  * Accumulating snowfall expected Christmas morning esp NW of I-95 * Strong to damaging wind gusts possible for southeast MA on Mon * Generally dry with well below average temperatures for the week  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  An active period to start the medium range with approaching system for Christmas Day. This is thanks to phasing between the northern and southern stream systems. Appears coastal low will become dominate as it undergoes cyclogenesis by Christmas morning. Still some uncertainty on the intensity and timing of when this will occur but the trends are pointing at a white Christmas north and west of I- 95. Afterwards, broad cyclonic flow will dominate the CONUS for much of the week. A few arctic shortwaves being introduced in the flow will bring reinforcing cold air, keeping temps well below normal through the period. Finally, may have to watch southern stream wave late in the week which could bring another round of wintry precip to the region thanks to cold airmass in place.  Details...  Sunday night into Christmas...Moderate confidence.  * Accumulating snowfall event into Christmas morning NW of I-95 * Strong, damaging winds on Monday for the Cape and Islands  A fast-moving shortwave trough will be heading towards the area overnight Sunday into Monday morning. Although this will be a quick moving and progressive wave, it is rather sharp and will be taking a more negative tilt. A surface low will develop in response to potent wave, moving across the eastern Great Lakes. Open wave at 700mb won`t cut-off until the low passes southern New England, closer into Maine. This will develop a secondary surface low off the coast of the Mid-Atlantic and strengthen the system in the Gulf of Maine, just north and east of SNE. The surface low appears to be moving inside the Benchmark, over the Cape/Canal. This will introduce BL temp issues for the region and thus pushing rain/snow line a bit farther west.  Currently expect widespread precip to move into the region after midnight from southwest to northeast as both surface lows begin to phase. Because this system is quick, precip should only last around 12 to 18 hours, ending Monday late morning. In fact across SE MA, we lose moisture in the snow growth region thus resulting in more drizzle toward Monday morning. Again biggest question is how far west the rain/snow line will make it. 2m temps indicate warm air making it into the I-95 corridor and even back into Hartford, CT. Model trends keep most of MA north of the Pike and esp north of route 2 below freezing leading to p-type mostly snow. Coastal low is quite close so BL temps are quite marginal. Models show some warming 950-850mb which could lead to rain or even some sleet. The EC is the coolest of the guidance with the RGEM the warmest. Continued a blend to account for bias. Lastly, as the low departs and strengthen over the Gulf of Maine, potent northerly cold air will dive into the region Monday morning transition any wintry mix into all snow for the NE portion of MA. All said in done, looks like advisory level snows, around 3-5 inches of much of the region away from the I-95 corridor. Higher amounts near route 2 which is closest to the dynamics of the surface low. Went ahead an issued a winter storm watch as snowfall amounts around 5-7 inches are possible in the region.  As the low pulls away and bombs, CAA will take hold of southern New England and low level jet will strengthen. Model guidance is consistent on 925 mb LLJ reaching between 45-60 kts by Monday afternoon. Within the CAA pattern, mixing will be quite strong especially near the ocean waters. This will also be amplified by the strong pressure falls. BUFKIT soundings continue to show strong mixing well up to 850 mb thus bringing the LLJ winds to the surface, resulting to 50-60 mph wind gusts Monday afternoon. Went ahead and issued a high wind watch for the Cape and Islands were confidence is highest at this time. Wind headlines will be needed for other portions of the area, but will hold off for now.  Overall this is a dynamic little system which will bring accumulating snow for a portion of southern New England by Christmas morning. Afterwards as the low pulls away, gusty winds will take hold which could result in down tree and powerlines, esp for Cape and Islands. Still a few details to be worked out but overall trends are there for the hazards. Stay up to date to the forecast as this system continues to evolve and we get into hi-res guidance.  Tuesday and beyond...  Broad cyclonic flow will continue through the period. Strong arctic high pressure will push into the Northern Plains and shift into the Great Lakes over the week. This high could move into the Northeast, as Greenland Block sets-up. This could result in temperatures falling into the single digits to below zero for overnight lows. High temps could remain in the 20s to teens. Below average for this time of year. Looking up the records, we may make a run at them on Thursday for low max temperatures.  Otherwise we continue to watch potential southern stream system late in the weekend into next weekend. Upper level pattern seems to jam up which will help slow down and strengthen upcoming vort max. A lot of spread in the guidance with timing and strength, but something to watch in the coming week. For now will watch models flip-flop and wobble with this snow chance.",

Freezing rain continues to impact the region along and northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor late this morning. Many roads and walkways are quite icy and there have been numerous reports of accidents this morning.  Most locations have received about a tenth of an inch of ice accretion through late morning. Given the track of the surface low pressure system near the I-95 corridor...should see temps rise above freezing in the Boston to Providence metro areas by early afternoon. In fact...the Providence to Taunton corridor should eventually reach into the 50s by early evening.  The forecast remains a bit more problematic across the interior and particularly central into interior northeast MA. Decent forcing will continue to result in widespread precipitation into the mid to late afternoon hours. Given the track of the surface low...there is not a strong mechanism to scour out the low level cold air. Nonetheless...latent heat release from the freezing rain process itself will eventually allow temps to come to around freezing if not degree or so above. However, the low level cold air will be most stubborn across parts of central and interior northeast MA with light northerly drainage. Therefore...the potential for one quarter to four tenths of an inch of ice accretion exists in this region. This will bring the risk for some downed tree limbs/isolated power outages this afternoon. While we should technically fall below Ice storm warning criteria, these ice amounts may be enough to cause some issues. This may be especially true Near the NH border where a few inches of snow/sleet covered branches. Something will have to monitor closely this afternoon. A special weather statement is in effect to address these concerns.",

Highest temps for the day will likely occur immediately behind the frontal passage as warm air aloft is able to mix down to the surface. All guid shows highs potentially jumping into the low 50s around 00z across CT/RI and eastern MA. This includes Hartford to Providence to Boston.  Could be some heavy showers along and ahead of the front as PWATs climb to +3 standard deviations along with some mid level instability as lapse rates approach moist adiabatic (6.5C/KM). Thus low risk of thunder.  Increasing winds in the warm sector along the south coast especially the islands as low level southwest jet traverses this area. Model soundings are inverted so not expecting much mixing other than in the heavier showers, but sustain winds could approach 30-35 mph in this region.  Overnight...

Morphology of small details in question however leaning with stronger synoptic lift and forcing over the N/W, especially with the convergence of E onshore flow along the high terrain beneath the main mid-level vort- max, moisture wrapping in along the 280-300K isentropic surfaces, a combination of parent frontogenesis and negative EPV, signals of potential instability.

Steepening lapse rates H8-6 and potential upright convection (thundersnow?). A nod to drying within the mid-levels, more likely a factor over S/E New England, however going to keep ice within the column given lengthy onshore E flow.  So continued thinking of broadscale ascent of light snow overnight, again the lack of lift through the dendritic growth zone, becoming moderate over N/E MA possibly extending down into the CT River Valley as the system rapidly deepens into Monday morning, better lift within the dendritic growth zone as it begins to close off at the mid-levels, and trowaling / deformation towards the NW quadrant of the low begins around Monday morning.

Only change with this forecast update is to include southern Bristol county of Massachusetts in the winter weather advisory as New Bedford and surrounding areas have dipped to AOB freezing. This in response to good northerly drainage flow to the the south coast. Bands of rain this morning will freeze on contact to untreated surfaces making for hazardous travel. Northern MA is of concern with temps only in the 20s and not expected to break freezing until sometime mid to late afternoon, ice accretion up to a 1/3 of an inch is possible. This may be sufficient to down branches and resulting in isolated power outages. Remainder of forecast is on track. Earlier discussion below.  =================================================================  Classic cold air damming (CAD) signature with 1030 mb surface high over New Brunswick along with weak surface wave/meso low southeast of Nantucket this morning. This providing northerly drainage flow across the entire region with subfreezing temps into coastal RI and interior southeast MA, with Boston at 27F at 3 am with light NW wind. Hi Res guid especially the NAM 3km capturing this shallow cold air fairly well and maintains CAD thru mid morning into the I-95 corridor before temps climb above freezing somewhere between 9 am - midday. This is hedging on the later side given models typically scour out shallow cold air too quickly.  Dry slot over the area during the predawn hours limits precip to freezing drizzle. However precip shield from upstream wave already advancing into southwest CT. Thus expect renewed icing to commence 4 am to 7 am from west to east. Ice accretion up to 0.05 inches is possible which will be sufficient for icy road conditions to continue especially any untreated surfaces. Thereafter (9am-12pm) precip will changeover to plain rain in the I-95 corridor. Some heavy downpours possible this afternoon as strong moisture advection yields PWATs climbing to +3 standard deviations.  Farther inland across northern CT and western-central MA, subfreezing temperatures persist at least until 18z and probably closer to 21z across Worcester county into northwest Middlesex county. This is hedging on the later side given models typically scour out shallow cold air too quickly.  Freezing drizzle during predawn hours will transition to a steadier freezing rain later this morning as precip shield from next upstream wave overspreads the area. Ice accretion across this area will be appreciable ranging from 0.15 to 0.25 inches. Some of the guidance is suggesting up to a third of an inch accretion possible across Worcester county into northwest Middlesex county. Thus some risk for down branches and isolated power outages.  This steadier and heavier precip will help erode the shallow cold air via precip drag mixing warm air aloft to the surface but also warming from the freezing process...latent heat of fusion.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...  *** Icy conditions overnight into Saturday across the interior  and for a time tonight to the I95 corridor ***  10 PM Update...  Back edge of precip shield now entering the I495 corridor of eastern MA. Ptype is mainly freezing rain except all rain along the immediate east coast and south coast of MA given onshore flow. Dry slot approaching from the west and will result in a bit of a lull overnight. However with moist low levels and dry air increasing aloft combined with subfreezing surface temps, this is very favorable setup for freezing drizzle overnight.  In addition, weak surface wave/meso low is currently south of Long Island NY per latest surface and buoy observations with modest pres falls just east of Cape Cod and Nantucket. Thus this wave will track just off the south coast and will exit into Georges Bank overnight. This will shift winds to the NNW and promote shallow cold air to drain southward into the I-95 corridor of MA/RI. Therefore have sped up the onset time for the advisory for Central RI including the Greater Providence area and into interior southeast MA. Have also included southern RI given shallow cold air will likely bleed southward to the shoreline. This will result in freezing drizzle overnight along with untreated surfaces becoming icy into Sat morning.  Previous Discussion...  Leaning heavily on high-res guidance for temperature/PoP trends through this evening. Regional radar mosaic shows most of light snow has lifted to our north, while we`re starting to see light snow and/or wintry mix developing in SNE due to increasing warm advection aloft, and additional activity developing upstream across eastern New York.  Light snow will re-develop along and north of Route 2 corridor late this afternoon and this evening, while precipitation farther to south should be more spotty in nature, and will slowly transition to wintry mix or light freezing rain. Later tonight, forecast soundings show drier air working into snow growth layer, which should give us lull in steadier precipitation and allow drizzle/freezing drizzle to dominate.  At same time, combination of warmer air coming in aloft and leftover cold near ground is expected to produce areas of dense fog, especially across interior valleys and in higher terrain. May need to consider Dense Fog Advisories in later forecasts.  Later tonight, weak low pressure exiting Cape Cod Bay will cause winds to back to N across much of eastern MA. This will cause lower level cold air to drain back down along coast, including Boston area and probably as far south as Providence and Taunton as well overnight. This drop in temperature will produce light icing from freezing drizzle and/or black ice. High-res guidance shows this potential clearly and has been very consistent.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/... Colder air will be slow to erode Saturday, especially across interior, as winds remain light from N/NE. Steadier rain should arrive first thing in morning which will result in freezing rain for much of morning, if not into early afternoon before temperatures finally rise above freezing. This looks to be borderline icing situation for much of SNE, aside from north central into interior NE MA where colder air will be tough to erode or mix out. For these areas, though, ice accretion should be limited to no more than 1/4 inch and main impact will be for travel.  Farther south, main concern is how far north milder (50s) air can get as warm front lifts toward south coast. Fairly large differences among models but majority of them keep milder air confined to south coast or even just Cape Cod and Islands. This makes sense when looking at overall pattern, in which low level cold air often wins battle, and this also has support from HREF and other high-res ensembles.  Cold front sweeps across SNE Saturday night, bringing an end to rain and eventual clearing as winds shift to NW.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... Highlights...  * Dry and comfortable Christmas Eve * Increasing snowfall potential for overnight Sunday into Christmas   morning * Generally dry but well below average temperatures for the week  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  An active period continues for the beginning of the medium range with approaching coastal system for Christmas Day. This is thanks to ongoing low pressure system followed by high pressure which seems to jam-up the upper level pattern. Models and ensembles continue to trend in surface cyclogenesis by Christmas morning but spatial and intensity differences continue and wont be resolved for another day or two. Afterwards, broad cyclonic flow will dominate the CONUS for much of the week. A few arctic shortwaves being introduced in the flow will bring reinforcing cold air, keeping temps well below normal through the period. Finally, may have to watch southern stream wave late in the week which could bring another round of wintry precip to the region thanks to cold airmass in place.  Details...  Christmas Eve...High confidence.  On-going low pressure system will be near the Maritimes by Sunday morning. High pressure will slide in from the west resulting in a brief period of quiet and dry weather. Sunshine to start, but clouds will begin to fill in ahead of the next system. Temperatures will warm into the mid 30s to low 40s.  Sunday night into Christmas...Moderate confidence.  A fast-moving shortwave trough will be heading towards the area for overnight Sunday into Monday morning. Although this will be a quick moving and progressive wave, it is rather sharp and will be starting to take on more of a negative tilt. Open wave at 700mb won`t cut-off into the low passes southern New England. This will develop a secondary surface low and strengthen the system in the Gulf of Maine, just north and east of SNE. However, if upper level pattern slows this system up then surface cyclogenesis may occur closer to the region increase snow chances. Aside from the placement of the low, it appears that there may be somewhat of an inverted trough that extends back into the region. Because of this, a period of steady snowfall looks to develop for Sunday night and continue into the morning hours on Monday.  Depending on strength and location of the secondary low, will also have to watch for where the rain/snow line will set-up. Current trends keep rain/snow line near the I-95 corridor. GEFS members show rain/snow line collapsing eastward as low pressure system strengthens and pulls away from the region. EC also shows a rain/snow line but it to collapses on the backside. Thus could see lower amounts across SE MA and higher snowfall amounts central southern New England. Now that the guidance is trending towards a solutions for the Christmas Holiday, confidence is increasing that plowable snowfall will occur. Still to early to throw out numbers as several mesoscale details need to be fine tuned, but could see advisory level snowfall, with the potential for 6+ across NE Mass. Both the EPS and GEFS are hinting at high probs of over 0.5 inches of snow in the NE Mass region. This is conjunction where models are indicating the inverted trough set-up. Again a lot to fine tune, but for those traveling on Christmas Day will need to monitor the forecast closely.  Aside from snowfall potential, wind could also be an issue. As the surface low undergoes cyclongensis, pressure gradient will tighten. This results in a strengthen low level jet with models showing a 40- 60 kt LLJ at 925mb. Not sure if it will all mix down but with strong pressure falls could increase the mixing. Will play conservative on wind gusts until we get into some of the hi-res guidance.  Overall confidence is increasing that a white Christmas will occur. Snowfall amounts could be plowable with 6+ inches possible in NE Mass. There is also the chance for strong gusty winds as the system strengthens and pulls away from the region. Stay tune for the latest on this system.  Tuesday and beyond...Moderate confidence.  Broad cyclonic flow will continue through the period. Strong arctic high pressure will push into the Northern Plains and shift into the Great Lakes over the week. This high could move into the Northeast, as Greenland Block sets-up. This could result in temperatures falling into the single digits to below zero for overnight lows. High temps could remain in the 20s to teens. Below average for this time of year.  Otherwise we continue to watch potential southern stream system late in the weekend into next weekend. Upper level pattern seems to jam up which will help slow down and strengthen upcoming vort max. A lot of spread in the guidance with timing and strength, but something to watch in the coming week. For now will watch models flip-flop and wobble with this snow chance.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/... 235 pm Update...  * Overall forecast on track with light icing for much of SNE. * Flash Freeze Possible in NE MA and Boston early Sat morning.  Leaning heavily on high-res guidance for temperature/PoP trends through this evening. Regional radar mosaic shows most of light snow has lifted to our north, while we`re starting to see light snow and/or wintry mix developing in SNE due to increasing warm advection aloft, and additional activity developing upstream across eastern New York.  Light snow will re-develop along and north of Route 2 corridor late this afternoon and this evening, while precipitation farther to south should be more spotty in nature, and will slowly transition to wintry mix or light freezing rain. Later tonight, forecast soundings show drier air working into snow growth layer, which should give us lull in steadier precipitation and allow drizzle/freezing drizzle to dominate.  At same time, combination of warmer air coming in aloft and leftover cold near ground is expected to produce areas of dense fog, especially across interior valleys and in higher terrain. May need to consider Dense Fog Advisories in later forecasts.  Later tonight, weak low pressure exiting Cape Cod Bay will cause winds to back to N across much of eastern MA. This will cause lower level cold air to drain back down along coast, including Boston area and probably as far south as Providence and Taunton as well overnight. This drop in temperature will produce light icing from freezing drizzle and/or black ice. High-res guidance shows this potential clearly and has been very consistent.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/... Colder air will be slow to erode Saturday, especially across interior, as winds remain light from N/NE. Steadier rain should arrive first thing in morning which will result in freezing rain for much of morning, if not into early afternoon before temperatures finally rise above freezing. This looks to be borderline icing situation for much of SNE, aside from north central into interior NE MA where colder air will be tough to erode or mix out. For these areas, though, ice accretion should be limited to no more than 1/4 inch and main impact will be for travel.  Farther south, main concern is how far north milder (50s) air can get as warm front lifts toward south coast. Fairly large differences among models but majority of them keep milder air confined to south coast or even just Cape Cod and Islands. This makes sense when looking at overall pattern, in which low level cold air often wins battle, and this also has support from HREF and other high-res ensembles.  Cold front sweeps across SNE Saturday night, bringing an end to rain and eventual clearing as winds shift to NW.",

Highlights...  * Dry and comfortable Christmas Eve * Increasing snowfall potential for overnight Sunday into Christmas   morning * Generally dry but well below average temperatures for the week  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  An active period continues for the beginning of the medium range with approaching coastal system for Christmas Day. This is thanks to ongoing low pressure system followed by high pressure which seems to jam-up the upper level pattern. Models and ensembles continue to trend in surface cyclogenesis by Christmas morning but spatial and intensity differences continue and wont be resolved for another day or two. Afterwards, broad cyclonic flow will dominate the CONUS for much of the week. A few arctic shortwaves being introduced in the flow will bring reinforcing cold air, keeping temps well below normal through the period. Finally, may have to watch southern stream wave late in the week which could bring another round of wintry precip to the region thanks to cold airmass in place.  Details...  Christmas Eve...High confidence.  On-going low pressure system will be near the Maritimes by Sunday morning. High pressure will slide in from the west resulting in a brief period of quiet and dry weather. Sunshine to start, but clouds will begin to fill in ahead of the next system.

However shallow cold air will remain entrenched just to the northwest of I-95. This combined with dry slot moving across the region will support periods of light freezing drizzle, except rain along and southeast of I-95 across southern RI into eastern MA. Temps in the evening will range from the upper 20s to lower 30s and may rise a few degs from the latent heat of fusion from the freezing rain/drizzle. However as previous forecaster noted a weak meso low will be traversing the warm front tracking east of Cape Cod. This frontal wave and it`s associated pres falls will shift/back surface winds to the NNW 06z-12z. This will enhance the cold air damming (CAD) signature and replenish the low level cold air from northern New England southward into our region. This will result in the area of freezing rain/drizzle shifting southeast back toward the I-95 corridor, including the city of Boston.  Saturday...  Departing meso low over the Gulf of Maine continues to enhance the CAD signature into interior MA/CT and northern RI, with shallow cold air remaining entrenched as NNE low level flow continues replenish cold air. High res guid has 2 meter temps in the upper 20s at 12z across northeast MA with freezing line very close to the I-95 corridor. This shallow cold air may not erode or mix out until the cold front sweeps across the area during the evening. Thus prolong period of freezing rain/drizzle appears likely northwest of I-95 with ice accretion totals of 0.15-0.25 inches, highest amounts over northern Worcester county into northern Middlesex county. Low risk of isolated down limbs and power outages in this area if higher end amounts verify. Lower amounts southeast toward I-95 and into northern CT, but still slippery travel expected.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Possible over-achieving warm temperatures on Sunday  - Snow expected around Monday morning, but exact impact uncertain  - Colder than average over the week, monitoring for any storms  */ Overview...  Potential holiday winter storm followed by nudging colder air and high pressure from the N/W along the SE periphery of which quick moving coastal storms are possible into the end of December.  Omega block ongoing over AK into the Arctic, cold air is dislodging and beginning to bowl S through a subsequent broad trof regime over Central Canada into the N-Central CONUS wobbling into the NE CONUS as waves rotate through the flow, either from Arctic source regions or straight from the Pacific as the omega block cuts off. Thermal gradient / baroclinic zone along the SE periphery, need to closely watch as waves cascade through. Pitch and amplitude all important factors with respect to cyclogenesis and whether we start to see a back-up in storm traffic across the N Atlantic.  A lot of moving parts, likely issues with model forecast guidance resolving individual waves, confidence is weighted towards ensemble means. An average of mass fields incorporating climatology / analogs as to possible outcomes, all of which will be outlined along with timing and forecast thinking in the discussion below.  */ Details...  Saturday night through Sunday evening...  Interrogating the airmass preceding a likely holiday winter storm. Separation from Arctic air via clipper low over S-Central Canada wedged ahead of CONUS continental surface high pressure provides an environment of light winds. If cloud decks remain scattered - broken then it`s likely we`ll overachieve on temperatures into the low to mid 40s. But also a part of this discussion is the remnant snow pack and ice from the Friday - Saturday storm. The N/W likely to remain colder whereas the S/E warms into the 40s, have a preference towards the 22.0z MET guidance.  Melt with consideration to surface dewpoints as clouds are on the increase towards the evening, all of which will have implications on evening into overnight temperatures towards Monday morning ahead of the holiday storm system, defining a rain / snow line through the sweeping storm as a N/NE isallobaric-ageostrophic component of flow manifests during the day Sunday increasing into the overnight period ahead of cyclogenesis and surface low pressure emerging off the Mid- Atlantic. Absent cold Arctic high N/E in this instance.  Overall, cold front pushing out Saturday evening, last of the precip mainly as rain pushing offshore. Quick breeze of NW winds then high pressure quickly settles in as low-mid level heights are on the rise out ahead of the negatively-tilting H5 trof and attendant vortmax digging over the OH River Valley, rotating cyclonically towards the NE CONUS.  Sunday evening through Monday...  Key here is the morphology of the potent shortwave with respect to the offshore baroclinic zone left by the trailing cold front from the Friday-Saturday storm system with consideration to the right rear quadrant of the accompanying H3 jet streak. GEFS members have pulled back to the W, closer to the coast, succinct with most of the operational model guidance, however several members remain well off- shore. And yet, interestingly enough, ECens members have pulled E including its operational counterpart. Still a tricky and uncertain forecast.  Yes, it looks like it`s going to snow, but the potency and snowfall amounts remain in question. The main H5 vortmax and parent surface wave sweeping into the NE CONUS, an energy transfer towards the off- shore baroclinic zone. Beneath broader diffluence and QG-forcing on top of New England, the mean of the right rear quadrant of the H3 jet streak immediately offshore. An eye on deformation and whether the system closes off at H85-7 with energy transfer, rapid deepening with cyclogenesis, a nod to the speed of the storm center overall.  So thinking initial broadscale ascent of light snow ahead of the negatively tilting H5 trof. No issue with ice in the column, perhaps some low level dry air to overcome, otherwise light snow settling in towards midnight. As the system cyclonically curves and begins to deepen, thinking there is a measure of W-E low to mid level fronto- genesis towards Monday morning yielding more moderate snow. However thinking the tilt towards the NW quadrant of the H85-7 low occurs further and quickly downstream as the low closes off, so it`ll be downeast ME and SE Canada that`ll bear the brunt of this storm. In other words the system doesn`t phase, moves too quickly, lacking the wrap around delivering warning level snows. Looking like advisory level snows.  As to the dividing line between rain and snow, generally around the I-95 corridor but a lot of wiggle room and uncertainty. More than likely amounts are going to fluctuate leading up to the event given 2m temperatures preceding along with the track of the low. Soundings during the event near isothermal, a wetter snow considered, colder air advecting into the low to mid levels not until the storm has passed and begun to rapidly deepen.  Climatology time ... last time is snowed more than an inch on 12/25 was back on 2002, a late day event that spilled into the 26th. BOS observed 5.5 inches when all was said and done, Hartford 7.8 inches. Prior to 2002, last time it snowed more than an inch was either 1978 in Hartford, 1974 in Boston, for Christmas day.  Monday night onward...  Quickly breezy behind the storm prior to high pressure building in. Going to have to watch the SE periphery of which up against the off- shore lingering baroclinic zone, as to whether additional storm development as waves continue to rotate through the broader cyclonic flow hugs closer to the coast. Likely to see some of the coldest air of the season given airmass dislodging over the Arctic, bowling S/E, reloading with energy continually being sheared S. Could be looking at a possible ebb and flow pattern during these reload periods in where warmer air is allowed to return N ahead of potential storm systems emerging out of the sub-tropical branch of the upper-level jet.

High pressure provides dry and seasonable weather Sunday. A fast moving developing coastal low may bring a brief period of snow except possibly rain for RI and southeast MA to the region late Sunday night into Christmas morning.  A colder than average week ahead into the following weekend during which time there`s the potential for another winter storm before the end of the month.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  *** Prolong Period Of Wintry Weather Today Thru Sat For Much Of Northern Massachusetts and northern Connecticut ***  330 AM Update...  1030 mb surface high over southern Quebec early this morning providing cold northerly flow into southern New England, with temperatures in the 20s but dew pts in the single digits and teens. Thus dry airmass in place. Short wave trough over the Great Lakes early this morning and accompanying low level jet over western PA/NY producing a band of light snow across central NY with snow as far east as Pittsfield, MA. All guidance has this band of WAA snows overspreading northern MA this morning from west to east, reaching the Greater Boston area between 9 pm - 12 pm.  Remainder of MA southward to RI and CT precip holds off until mid to late afternoon as low level dry air takes time to erode. However during this time dry slot enters the snow growth region (-10c to - 20c), increasing the likelihood of freezing rain given the lack of ice nuclei and also result in low to modest SLR (snow to liquid ratios). This will limit snow accumulations with highest totals of 2- 5\" across northern MA, especially RT-2 corridor to the MA-VT and MA- NH border. Snowfall diminishes rapidly southward to an inch or two along and near the MA pike into the Greater Boston area, with an inch or less across northern CT-RI into southeast MA. However this area will see snow quickly changing to freezing rain-drizzle and/or sleet-ice pellets. This will yield slippery travel as it only takes a glaze of ice to impact road conditions. Along the south coast of RI and MA little if any accumulation expected given a quick transition to rain.  By 00z warm air aloft is surging northward toward the MA/NH border, bringing an end to accumulating snow this evening for northern Massachusetts. Thus not a big snow event, it`s the freezing rain and sleet late today that will impact travel.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM SATURDAY/...  330 AM update...  Tonight...  As noted in the previous section temps warm aloft after 00z bringing an end to the snow. However shallow cold air will remain entrenched just to the northwest of I-95. This combined with dry slot moving across the region will support periods of light freezing drizzle, except rain along and southeast of I-95 across southern RI into eastern MA. Temps in the evening will range from the upper 20s to lower 30s and may rise a few degs from the latent heat of fusion from the freezing rain/drizzle. However as previous forecaster noted a weak meso low will be traversing the warm front tracking east of Cape Cod. This frontal wave and it`s associated pres falls will shift/back surface winds to the NNW 06z-12z. This will enhance the cold air damming (CAD) signature and replenish the low level cold air from northern New England southward into our region. This will result in the area of freezing rain/drizzle shifting southeast back toward the I-95 corridor, including the city of Boston.  Saturday...  Departing meso low over the Gulf of Maine continues to enhance the CAD signature into interior MA/CT and northern RI, with shallow cold air remaining entrenched as NNE low level flow continues replenish cold air. High res guid has 2 meter temps in the upper 20s at 12z across northeast MA with freezing line very close to the I-95 corridor. This shallow cold air may not erode or mix out until the cold front sweeps across the area during the evening. Thus prolong period of freezing rain/drizzle appears likely northwest of I-95 with ice accretion totals of 0.15-0.25 inches, highest amounts over northern Worcester county into northern Middlesex county. Low risk of isolated down limbs and power outages in this area if higher end amounts verify. Lower amounts southeast toward I-95 and into northern CT, but still slippery travel expected.  No change to previous headlines other than extending (in duration) the winter weather advisory for northern MA until late Sat afternoon.  For RI and southeast MA could see a period of heavy showers Sat as PWATs surge up to +2 standard deviations combined with strong frontal convergence from multiple waves riding the front.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - Possible over-achieving warm temperatures on Sunday  - Snow expected around Monday morning, but exact impact uncertain  - Colder than average over the week, monitoring for any storms  */ Overview...  Potential holiday winter storm followed by nudging colder air and high pressure from the N/W along the SE periphery of which quick moving coastal storms are possible into the end of December.  Omega block ongoing over AK into the Arctic, cold air is dislodging and beginning to bowl S through a subsequent broad trof regime over Central Canada into the N-Central CONUS wobbling into the NE CONUS as waves rotate through the flow, either from Arctic source regions or straight from the Pacific as the omega block cuts off. Thermal gradient / baroclinic zone along the SE periphery, need to closely watch as waves cascade through. Pitch and amplitude all important factors with respect to cyclogenesis and whether we start to see a back-up in storm traffic across the N Atlantic.  A lot of moving parts, likely issues with model forecast guidance resolving individual waves, confidence is weighted towards ensemble means. An average of mass fields incorporating climatology / analogs as to possible outcomes, all of which will be outlined along with timing and forecast thinking in the discussion below.  */ Details...  Saturday night through Sunday evening...  Interrogating the airmass preceding a likely holiday winter storm. Separation from Arctic air via clipper low over S-Central Canada wedged ahead of CONUS continental surface high pressure provides an environment of light winds. If cloud decks remain scattered - broken then it`s likely we`ll overachieve on temperatures into the low to mid 40s. But also a part of this discussion is the remnant snow pack and ice from the Friday - Saturday storm. The N/W likely to remain colder whereas the S/E warms into the 40s, have a preference towards the 22.0z MET guidance.  Melt with consideration to surface dewpoints as clouds are on the increase towards the evening, all of which will have implications on evening into overnight temperatures towards Monday morning ahead of the holiday storm system, defining a rain / snow line through the sweeping storm as a N/NE isallobaric-ageostrophic component of flow manifests during the day Sunday increasing into the overnight period ahead of cyclogenesis and surface low pressure emerging off the Mid- Atlantic. Absent cold Arctic high N/E in this instance.  Overall, cold front pushing out Saturday evening, last of the precip mainly as rain pushing offshore. Quick breeze of NW winds then high pressure quickly settles in as low-mid level heights are on the rise out ahead of the negatively-tilting H5 trof and attendant vortmax digging over the OH River Valley, rotating cyclonically towards the NE CONUS.  Sunday evening through Monday...  Key here is the morphology of the potent shortwave with respect to the offshore baroclinic zone left by the trailing cold front from the Friday-Saturday storm system with consideration to the right rear quadrant of the accompanying H3 jet streak. GEFS members have pulled back to the W, closer to the coast, succinct with most of the operational model guidance, however several members remain well off- shore. And yet, interestingly enough, ECens members have pulled E including its operational counterpart. Still a tricky and uncertain forecast.  Yes, it looks like it`s going to snow, but the potency and snowfall amounts remain in question. The main H5 vortmax and parent surface wave sweeping into the NE CONUS, an energy transfer towards the off- shore baroclinic zone. Beneath broader diffluence and QG-forcing on top of New England, the mean of the right rear quadrant of the H3 jet streak immediately offshore. An eye on deformation and whether the system closes off at H85-7 with energy transfer, rapid deepening with cyclogenesis, a nod to the speed of the storm center overall.  So thinking initial broadscale ascent of light snow ahead of the negatively tilting H5 trof. No issue with ice in the column, perhaps some low level dry air to overcome, otherwise light snow settling in towards midnight. As the system cyclonically curves and begins to deepen, thinking there is a measure of W-E low to mid level fronto- genesis towards Monday morning yielding more moderate snow. However thinking the tilt towards the NW quadrant of the H85-7 low occurs further and quickly downstream as the low closes off, so it`ll be downeast ME and SE Canada that`ll bear the brunt of this storm. In other words the system doesn`t phase, moves too quickly, lacking the wrap around delivering warning level snows. Looking like advisory level snows.  As to the dividing line between rain and snow, generally around the I-95 corridor but a lot of wiggle room and uncertainty. More than likely amounts are going to fluctuate leading up to the event given 2m temperatures preceding along with the track of the low. Soundings during the event near isothermal, a wetter snow considered, colder air advecting into the low to mid levels not until the storm has passed and begun to rapidly deepen.  Climatology time ... last time is snowed more than an inch on 12/25 was back on 2002, a late day event that spilled into the 26th. BOS observed 5.5 inches when all was said and done, Hartford 7.8 inches. Prior to 2002, last time it snowed more than an inch was either 1978 in Hartford, 1974 in Boston, for Christmas day.  Monday night onward...  Quickly breezy behind the storm prior to high pressure building in. Going to have to watch the SE periphery of which up against the off- shore lingering baroclinic zone, as to whether additional storm development as waves continue to rotate through the broader cyclonic flow hugs closer to the coast. Likely to see some of the coldest air of the season given airmass dislodging over the Arctic, bowling S/E, reloading with energy continually being sheared S. Could be looking at a possible ebb and flow pattern during these reload periods in where warmer air is allowed to return N ahead of potential storm systems emerging out of the sub-tropical branch of the upper-level jet.

    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...  *** Wintry Mix Will Make For Hazardous Conditions Fri-Sat ***  Initially, warm front associated with nose of weak LLJ will lead to broad isentropic lift across the region early morning into Fri afternoon. Lift and moistening through the -12C to -18C DGZ is expected through early afternoon however, soundings show relatively dry air below H8 particularly S of the Mass Pike through much of the day, which should limit snowfall accumulations there. Areas where best dendritic growth, moisture and lift coincide remains along and north of Route 2 in MA, with SN beginning around 3-5AM and shifting ESE through 15Z. Will feature an area with 2-4 inches along/N of Route 2, 1-3 along the Mass Pike to Route 2, with a coating to an inch in N CT/RI and SE MA. Areas along the immediate S coast will likely be too warm by the time afternoon precip begins.  Fri afternoon and evening, there is a gradual shift as a meso low pres develops along the warm frontal boundary which continues to attempt a N shift. At the same time, noting a dry slot aloft, which will limit moisture in the DGZ while the lower lvls moisten. This will lead to less ice through the column and lack of dendritic growth should allow for a S-N switch to sleet then to light FZRA through the evening hours. Meso-low will also enhance isallobaric drainage flow with winds shifting more NNE through the evening and overnight within a regime signaling a classic cold air damming signature (inverted ridge, N flow). While temps through the day will likely be below freezing away from the coast thanks to this CAD signature, the enhanced northerlies provided by the mesolow could even lead to an overnight cooling effect, leading to more widespread freezing. Final QPF totals through Fri night rest between the 0.25 to 0.5 mark, and given temps will be in the 20s along the MA NH/VT border, this is where highest ice accums are likely. Will highlight 0.1-0.25in ice accums mainly N of the Pike, with a T-0.1 further S.  All this warrants expansion of Winter WX Advisories. Will be hoisting for all of N CT/RI and the remainder of MA outside of the SE coastal plain (Bristol/Plymouth, Cape/Islands).  Timing...Snow begins early AM in N MA, shifting to the remainder of S New England after sunrise through mid day. Transition to ice occurs late afternoon and evening, with peak accretion expected during the evening and overnight hours Fri.  Uncertainty...As in any mixed precip event, the transition times may be off a bit as well as the exact location of the rain/snow/ice lines. These will continue to be better defined, but have enough certainty in the details now to expand advisories. Even a T of ice will make untreated surfaces slippery and hazardous.  Another layer of uncertainty rests particularly along E coastal MA. Should sfc lvl flow take on a more E component, it would draw in marine air where SSTs are around 40-43F. This may warm sfc temps sufficiently to limit ice accretion. This will need to be watched.",

Larger scale pattern features persistent closed low over southern Canada into next week which keeps northern tier of states under broad cyclonic flow and results in below average temperatures for much of period, as SE Atlantic ridge (and any hopes of early winter warmth) are shunted well south into Caribbean. Coldest of airmass is slated to arrive after Christmas Day with highs in teens and 20s most of next week, although core of coldest air appears to stay to our west and undergoes some \"modification\" as it arrives here.  Saturday...  Temperatures slowly warm across interior as low level ageostrophic flow weakens and cold air damming slowly loses its grip. For much of area from northern CT into western and central MA, transition to rain probably won`t take place until late morning or early afternoon. Meanwhile, warm front lifting north across region will bring significant warmup to much of RI and southeast MA, where model 2-meter temperatures are in good agreement that readings will rise into 50s Saturday afternoon. Question is how far north warmer air will get - as it`s entirely possible it stays closer to Providence- Plymouth corridor or manages to make it farther north into Metro Boston. Big bust potential here with high temperatures, but right now we are more confident that 50s will stay just to south of Boston. However at 48-60 hours out in time, this will need to be adjusted in later forecasts.  Christmas Eve into Christmas Day...  Ensembles and 12z models are showing fairly decent potential for accumulating snowfall, mainly from later at night on Christmas Eve into Christmas morning. Models are keying on short wave energy rounding base of broad upper trough, which are highly subject to timing differences and errors at 3+ days out in time. What we have been seeing over past few model runs is an open wave at 700 mb that eventually closes off to our east, with a range of surface low tracks from just off SNE coast (12z GFS) to well outside 40/70 benchmark. Even if more offshore track (12z ECMWF) verifies presence of an inverted trough extending back toward coast would still bring accumulating snow to much of SNE, especially to RI and eastern MA.  These inverted troughs can easily \"overperform\" and bring more snow than one would normally expect with a more offshore track. That said, overall pattern with an open wave aloft which is progressive would suggest most likely snowfall accumulations somewhere in Winter Weather Advisory range (perhaps 2-5\") and not an extreme event, although a few spots could come in with slightly higher totals. Certainly something we will fine tune in next day or so, especially once models are able to determine this short wave`s interaction with what occurs Fri-Sat.

Periods of wintry weather and travel impacts through the holidays followed by cold, dry weather per dominant high pressure, with perhaps some skirting coastal storms towards the end of the month.  The wave breaking out over the N-Central Pacific / Hawaii from the MJO-enhanced Pacific jet, undergoing a negative tilt with additional trof energy cascading through, beginning to see the warm-moist surge N towards Alaska into the Arctic, building the H5 ridge maintaining the high height anomaly through the stratosphere, dislodging cold, tropospheric air across N Canada, bowling S/E into N-Central CONUS.  Upstream pattern becoming amplified, Arctic omega block cutting off, energy shears downstream, digging over the W/SW CONUS up against a strong sub-tropical H5 ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Subsequent SW to NE thermal gradient / baroclinic zone of Arctic and sub-tropical airmasses across the E CONUS wavers S/E along which H5 disturbances stretch and eject quickly, the first series of which just starting to sweep across the W CONUS / 4-corners region will usher a wintry mix Friday night through Saturday night, the second over Alaska will later dig across the N-Central CONUS obtaining a negative tilt over the NE just in time for the holidays.  As to the forecast specifics,  still exercising caution. Noteworthy ensemble member spread and variance within deterministic guidance. Models seemingly struggling with the resolving of individual waves, juxtapositioning of airmasses. Confidence weighted towards ensemble means / probabilistics, interrogating as to where there`s broadscale agreement on potential threats and impacts. Will continue to weight ensemble averages of various mass fields incorporating climatology / analogs as to possible outcomes, all of which will be outlined along with timing and forecast thinking in the discussion below.  After the holidays, a 1040+ surface pressure looks to dominate over the N-Central CONUS, pushing into the NE CONUS, its SE periphery up against anomalously warm NW Atlantic waters, a potential baroclinic focus for additional storm development further out in time over what is otherwise a fairly progressive downstream pattern across the N Atlantic. Low confidence given the poor handling of storm systems within the mid-range forecast period. Leave it at that and avoid further discussion below.  */ Details...  Friday night...  Pacific energy acting as the kicker of a sheared disturbance across the SW CONUS, both dig N/E towards the NE CONUS. Enhanced H5 ridging Friday night, both subsidence and drying within the dendritic growth zone as warmer air pushes in aloft (shortly after midnight), but not absolutely certain as to whether ice is completely stripped from the column. Leaning towards drizzly/light precipitation, while mainly in the form of freezing rain across the N/W interior can`t rule out sleet mixing in and as a result potentially tipping the balance one way or the other to either snow/sleet accums or ice accretion. Some concern given low SREF probs of freezing rain >= 0.01\", however WPC notably higher.  No clear signal from a weighting of 21.0z NAM / EC / Canadian, yet can`t ignore the persistent CIPS analogs of a > 6 hour freezing rain event. Leaning more with freezing rain, ice accretions during this time-frame up around a tenth over the N/W interior. Rain along the coast, moderate at times associated with a low level jet / thermal wind response in wake of the initial Pacific energy on Friday.  Saturday into Saturday night...  The pair of mid-level disturbances quickly approaching, convergent low-level forcing prevails in advance. While still unclear on the track of the surface-H925 low, anticipating waves along the front that are going to keep the surface winds turned to the N. This as we`re expecting a slug of precipitation along the nose of the low- level jet subsequent of a dynamic thermal wind response tightening of the thermal gradient prior to the cold front, again beneath which cold air damming prevails. So holding onto cold air longer well into Saturday evening and resultant freezing rain threat. Warm front kinked up along the MA / NH / VT border.  Obvious challenges as to the magnitude/duration of cold air damming, do anticipate the ageostrophic-isallobaric N/NE flow to prevail not flipping S/SW until the low / cold front passes Saturday evening.  The decent slug of precipitation towards Saturday morning perhaps followed by a brief period of dry weather via dry slot / warm sector aloft before another slug of precipitation follows along the cold front. Dependence on amplitude and energy associated with low to mid level features, but aside, expect that sub-freezing temperatures will be slow to erode and perhaps locked throughout the event over N/NE areas of MA. Again, a nod to the consistent > 6 hour freezing rain signal from CIPS analogs and ensemble probabilities of max 2m temperature over 32F. Leaned towards the 21.0z EC / NAM / Canadian, the colder side of solutions.  Storm total snow amounts of around 1-4 inches, locally higher on the N/W high terrain before the change-over Friday night. Storm total ice accretion of around 0.1-0.2 over the N/W interior away from the coastal plain, again locally higher across the high terrain. Travel impacts to be significant. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES posted through Saturday for snow / ice impacts.  Cold front sweeping through Saturday night towards Sunday morning. Precipitation quickly coming to an end. A final note, a pronounced low level jet to which high-res guidance progs at 70 to 80 mph at H925. However warm air advection aloft looks to limit potential mixing down to the surface, and in addition there is much signal support from CIPS Analogs. A blend of EC / NAM / Canadian wind fields with a factor of winds at H925 yield the likelihood of SW gales over the waters prior to cold frontal passage.  Sunday through Monday night...  Potential snow storm Sunday night into Monday with a dividing rain / snow line. Two camps: GFS versus EC / Canadian / UKmet. Prevailing with the 21.0z EC ensemble, looking at a quick moving coastal storm setup with associated strong QG-forcing given the negative tilt of a H5 trof axis and pronounced vortmax rotating through beneath the right-rear quadrant of an upper level jet streak. Baroclinic leaf progression towards a closed low however the ensemble mean has the H85-7 low closing off further down-stream. Left with more of a continental-origin airmass before the cyclonic branch of the warm- moist conveyor belt is trowaled to the rear.

Already noting a reduction in pressure rise/fall couplet which is coincident with a slight decrease in afternoon wind gusts. This trend should continue through the evening, but agree with previous forecaster that the couplet and resulting sfc pres gradient may not slacken enough through the overnight hours for full decoupling in spite of increasing subsidence inversion and diminishing cloud cover early. Will still lean on the coldest available guidance however, as some of the more sheltered valleys could decouple near daybreak, which was observed this morning in a regime with even tighter gradient.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Wintry weather expected Thursday night through Saturday morning  - Another round of wintry weather forecast Sunday through Monday  - Likely holiday travel impacts throughout late week / weekend  - Cold and dry conditions under high pressure from Tuesday onward  */ Overview...  Potential pair of mixed precip events into the holidays followed up by a prolonged period of cold, dry weather heralded by a strong area of high pressure. Breaking down the pattern west to east.  Learning from others. MJO-induced convection over W-Central Pacific and SE Asia enhances a W-E jet over the NW Pacific. At the exit out by HI, towards a Kona Low, the wave breaks. With additional energy cascading through the jet over time, it extends E tapping deep into the warm, moist tropics and parent energy. Negatively tilting at H5 at the wave break, warm-moist air is forecast to eject N invoking H5 ridging across AK into the Arctic. Continued energy upstream, the H5 ridge builds yielding an omega block, gradually cutting off. Colder Arctic air over N Canada is dislodged and bowled gradually S and E into the holidays, lingering into the end of December. Potentially some of the coldest air of this season concurrent with surface high pressure as high as 1060 mb.  As the H5 ridge builds over AK into the Arctic, cold air bowled S/E, attendant energy through the H5 longwave pattern shears, cascading S over the SW CONUS. A H3 sub-tropical jet anomaly out ahead extending back into the E-Central Pacific, the N Atlantic H5 ridge builds SW across the Gulf of Mexico. This sets up a SW-NE thermal transitional zone, a dividing line between above and below freezing temperatures, subsequent thermal wind response, shifting S/E along which the afore- mentioned sheared energy over the SW CONUS stretches as it ejects NE along the thermal gradient across the E CONUS.  It`s a pair of waves we`ll need to watch closely along the SW to NE gradient that have the potential of delivering mixed precip events during the holiday season before high pressure and cold Arctic air wobble S/E for the remainder of December ushering drier conditions.  But a word of caution. As discerned from ensemble members and run-to- run operational model consistency, there is poor model resolving of such individual waves lending to vast spread of potential outcomes. It`s difficult to get into specifics and focus in on one particular model solution. Waffling of wave energy along with both magnitude and amplitude of parent airmasses, considerable variance among all available forecast guidance, with this forecast will put greatest weight on ensemble means, keying in on signals and analogs while incorporating climatology based on an ensemble average of forecast synoptics.  Breaking down potential threats and impacts in the discussion below along with forecast confidence, will try to be as clear as possible with respect to timing.  */ Details...  Thursday night through Saturday night...  Focusing on ensemble means, broadly speaking, with the surface low tracking NE across the OH River Valley and the E Great Lakes, high pressure and colder air hugging N/E, low-level component of ageo- strophic / isallobaric flow should result in cold air holding out longer prior to being eroded, especially if such flow is more N than E, originating from snow pack interior. In fact, ensemble means have slowed with the erosion of sub-freezing H85 air and have brought the surface pressure centers closer together.  Leaning that low levels will gradually warm with time, but stubborn more so at the surface. Nod to wet-bulb temperatures, not expecting the last of the sub-freezing air to erode out of N/NE Massachusetts until the surface low passes N/W of S New England during Saturday morning. 20.0z NAM has the right idea with 2m wet bulb temperatures but appears too quick on the warming Friday night, the consideration of a potential coastal front setup. 20.0z EC has the timing down but perhaps is too quick on warming temperatures over NE Massachusetts given the expected ageostrophic-isallobaric flow. A blend between the two is favored within the gridded forecast in respect to 2m wet- bulb temperatures.  So thinking initial snows Thursday night into Friday, an average 1 to 3 inch event, stronger isallobaric ascent not materializing until Friday along the 290-300K surfaces thru the dendritic growth zone. A short period prior to drying aloft limiting the presence of ice and thus resulting in a change-over to freezing rain. Higher amounts of snowfall over N/W higher terrain of MA considering higher snow to liquid ratios.  Change-over Friday night per ensemble mean signaling H925-85 over- running warmer air, drying thru the dendritic growth zone, freezing rain occurring especially over the N/W interior, early guess of ice accumulations potentially up to a tenth of an inch. CIPS analogs for awhile now signaling a high probability of a 6-hour event. The SREF means just trickling in with up to around a 40 percent probability of 0.01 inch ice accumulation over N/W MA by Friday evening. Worth noting, it`s towards late Friday into Friday night that over-running ascent kicks into overdrive along 290-300K surfaces per consensus of model guidance. Strong omega forcing through the atmospheric column as synoptics / dynamics come together, strong SW jet subsequent with parent convergent forcing along the low-level warm front. Precip rates during potential icing will have to be watched closely, how quick the warm front lifts N, drier air following as noted below.  Freezing rain lingering into the morning hours on Saturday before going over to rain at which point the surface low will have passed off to our N/W, the ageostrophic-isallobaric component shifting S no longer kinking the surface warm front resulting it to sweep N. A possible dry slot moving in along with a robust low-level jet, will need to monitor for possible wind headlines prior to the cold front Saturday night with a shot at some wet weather.  Sunday through Monday night...  Secondary wave low along the lingering baroclinic zone / cold front sweeping NE just immediately offshore of S New England per ensemble means. Wanting to hug it closer beneath the H5 trof digging and undergoing a negative tilt with parent main vort max. Colder air digging S as ascent of the anticyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt is pulled back along the 280-300K isentropic surfaces, precip shield extending W towards the aforementioned main vort max. Looking at a mainly snow event, but specifics remain uncertain. Leaning an EC / UKmet blend. The H85-7 low key, proximity, whether it is closing off, interrogating for the rain / snow line and the axis of heavier snowfall the mean of which is more across N/W areas of the NE CONUS. Until forecast models can better resolve outcomes concerning the first storm for the Friday into Saturday timeframe can we gain more confidence concerning the secondary storm system progged for this timeframe.  Tuesday onward...  Cold and dry. Given so much uncertainty in the timeframe prior, will lean with ensemble means of high pressure and Arctic air gradually bowling S/E into the NE CONUS. Looking at the possibility of some of the coldest air of the season as we go into the later half of the week, closing out December which already is on average 2 degrees below average for the month. Looking as if we`ll edge out colder for the monthly average.",

Will have to see how 12z models trend.  Winds trending light as ridge of high pres builds into the area. NNW wind may yield some ocean effect cloudiness for the outer Cape and Nantucket especially during the morning.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...  345 AM update...  */ Highlights...   - Wintry weather expected Thursday night through Saturday morning  - Another round of wintry weather forecast Sunday through Monday  - Likely holiday travel impacts throughout late week / weekend  - Cold and dry conditions under high pressure from Tuesday onward  */ Overview...  Potential pair of mixed precip events into the holidays followed up by a prolonged period of cold, dry weather heralded by a strong area of high pressure. Breaking down the pattern west to east.  Learning from others. MJO-induced convection over W-Central Pacific and SE Asia enhances a W-E jet over the NW Pacific. At the exit out by HI, towards a Kona Low, the wave breaks. With additional energy cascading through the jet over time, it extends E tapping deep into the warm, moist tropics and parent energy. Negatively tilting at H5 at the wave break, warm-moist air is forecast to eject N invoking H5 ridging across AK into the Arctic. Continued energy upstream, the H5 ridge builds yielding an omega block, gradually cutting off. Colder Arctic air over N Canada is dislodged and bowled gradually S and E into the holidays, lingering into the end of December. Potentially some of the coldest air of this season concurrent with surface high pressure as high as 1060 mb.  As the H5 ridge builds over AK into the Arctic, cold air bowled S/E, attendant energy through the H5 longwave pattern shears, cascading S over the SW CONUS. A H3 sub-tropical jet anomaly out ahead extending back into the E-Central Pacific, the N Atlantic H5 ridge builds SW across the Gulf of Mexico. This sets up a SW-NE thermal transitional zone, a dividing line between above and below freezing temperatures, subsequent thermal wind response, shifting S/E along which the afore- mentioned sheared energy over the SW CONUS stretches as it ejects NE along the thermal gradient across the E CONUS.  It`s a pair of waves we`ll need to watch closely along the SW to NE gradient that have the potential of delivering mixed precip events during the holiday season before high pressure and cold Arctic air wobble S/E for the remainder of December ushering drier conditions.  But a word of caution. As discerned from ensemble members and run-to- run operational model consistency, there is poor model resolving of such individual waves lending to vast spread of potential outcomes. It`s difficult to get into specifics and focus in on one particular model solution. Waffling of wave energy along with both magnitude and amplitude of parent airmasses, considerable variance among all available forecast guidance, with this forecast will put greatest weight on ensemble means, keying in on signals and analogs while incorporating climatology based on an ensemble average of forecast synoptics.  Breaking down potential threats and impacts in the discussion below along with forecast confidence, will try to be as clear as possible with respect to timing.  */ Details...  Thursday night through Saturday night...  Focusing on ensemble means, broadly speaking, with the surface low tracking NE across the OH River Valley and the E Great Lakes, high pressure and colder air hugging N/E, low-level component of ageo- strophic / isallobaric flow should result in cold air holding out longer prior to being eroded, especially if such flow is more N than E, originating from snow pack interior. In fact, ensemble means have slowed with the erosion of sub-freezing H85 air and have brought the surface pressure centers closer together.  Leaning that low levels will gradually warm with time, but stubborn more so at the surface. Nod to wet-bulb temperatures, not expecting the last of the sub-freezing air to erode out of N/NE Massachusetts until the surface low passes N/W of S New England during Saturday morning. 20.0z NAM has the right idea with 2m wet bulb temperatures but appears too quick on the warming Friday night, the consideration of a potential coastal front setup. 20.0z EC has the timing down but perhaps is too quick on warming temperatures over NE Massachusetts given the expected ageostrophic-isallobaric flow. A blend between the two is favored within the gridded forecast in respect to 2m wet- bulb temperatures.  So thinking initial snows Thursday night into Friday, an average 1 to 3 inch event, stronger isallobaric ascent not materializing until Friday along the 290-300K surfaces thru the dendritic growth zone. A short period prior to drying aloft limiting the presence of ice and thus resulting in a change-over to freezing rain. Higher amounts of snowfall over N/W higher terrain of MA considering higher snow to liquid ratios.  Change-over Friday night per ensemble mean signaling H925-85 over- running warmer air, drying thru the dendritic growth zone, freezing rain occurring especially over the N/W interior, early guess of ice accumulations potentially up to a tenth of an inch. CIPS analogs for awhile now signaling a high probability of a 6-hour event. The SREF means just trickling in with up to around a 40 percent probability of 0.01 inch ice accumulation over N/W MA by Friday evening. Worth noting, it`s towards late Friday into Friday night that over-running ascent kicks into overdrive along 290-300K surfaces per consensus of model guidance. Strong omega forcing through the atmospheric column as synoptics / dynamics come together, strong SW jet subsequent with parent convergent forcing along the low-level warm front. Precip rates during potential icing will have to be watched closely, how quick the warm front lifts N, drier air following as noted below.  Freezing rain lingering into the morning hours on Saturday before going over to rain at which point the surface low will have passed off to our N/W, the ageostrophic-isallobaric component shifting S no longer kinking the surface warm front resulting it to sweep N. A possible dry slot moving in along with a robust low-level jet, will need to monitor for possible wind headlines prior to the cold front Saturday night with a shot at some wet weather.  Sunday through Monday night...  Secondary wave low along the lingering baroclinic zone / cold front sweeping NE just immediately offshore of S New England per ensemble means. Wanting to hug it closer beneath the H5 trof digging and undergoing a negative tilt with parent main vort max. Colder air digging S as ascent of the anticyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt is pulled back along the 280-300K isentropic surfaces, precip shield extending W towards the aforementioned main vort max. Looking at a mainly snow event, but specifics remain uncertain. Leaning an EC / UKmet blend. The H85-7 low key, proximity, whether it is closing off, interrogating for the rain / snow line and the axis of heavier snowfall the mean of which is more across N/W areas of the NE CONUS. Until forecast models can better resolve outcomes concerning the first storm for the Friday into Saturday timeframe can we gain more confidence concerning the secondary storm system progged for this timeframe.  Tuesday onward...  Cold and dry. Given so much uncertainty in the timeframe prior, will lean with ensemble means of high pressure and Arctic air gradually bowling S/E into the NE CONUS. Looking at the possibility of some of the coldest air of the season as we go into the later half of the week, closing out December which already is on average 2 degrees below average for the month. Looking as if we`ll edge out colder for the monthly average.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...  10 PM Update...  Warm sector remains across much of southern New England with temps 45-50 at 930 pm! Gusty SW winds up to 25-30 mph continue in this warm sector. The surface cold front was moving across western MA with a wind shift to the WNW at PSF and AQW. A band of light rain showers was draped across northern MA ahead of the cold front. 00z ALY sounding revealed a pronounced dry layer below 850 mb. This is resulting in high cloud bases around 5-6kft along with some of the precip drying up before reaching the ground. Thus only expecting some light rain showers this evening.  True cold air doesn`t arrive until morning, so any showers will be rain. Will have to watch late tonight into Wed morning as this colder air streams across the Lake Ontario and lake effect snows really get cranking. One of these streamers is progged by some of the new Hi Res guid (including 00z NAM 3KM and HRRR) to traverse into the RT-2 corridor of northern MA and possibly the Greater Boston area 09z-12z. Temps will likely be cold enough to support snow showers by then. However any lake effect bands into MA should be fairly weak given lack of low level convergence and limited low level moisture. Nonetheless, worth watching as these mesoscale bands have a limit of predictability.  Otherwise previous forecast remains on track with only changes to hourly temps to better capture current conditions. Earlier discussion below.  =================================================================  Previous Discussion...  A weakening secondary cold front is draped from NE NY through central PA at the time of this writing. Noting however, that the low-mid lvl cold front is likely to push ahead of the weakening sfc front allowing mid lvl temps to drop faster aloft than the PBL as mentioned above. Soundings show decent steepening of sfc to H7 lapse rates, approaching 7-8C/km. At the same time as lower-mid lvl wind fields shift W a 100-200hPa layer of moisture associated with remnant lake effect streamers will also shift across the region ahead of the advancing sfc front. This could allow for some iso-sct showers to develop during the evening hours through early morning as the front advances. Temps near the sfc may help define mainly SHRA as lift is relatively weak initially and there is an overall lack of moisture within the better DGZ. However, a few SHSN are possible thanks to diurnal help later in the overnight hours, so will gradually transition WX toward SN later, but this will also be accompanied by drier air. Best chance for precip remains the E slopes of the Berkshires where an upslope component to the flow ill be maximized, but would not be surprised to see these showers make it to the higher terrain of central MA/CT and N RI as well. Given the bulk of the moisture is in the narrow 200hPa layer mentioned above, an accums would be very light.  Overnight mins will not have the benefit of the deeper cold dome and a strengthening pres gradient would limit any decoupling with early AM clearing. Expect that temps will only drop into the low-mid 30s overnight.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Tomorrow... 1025+ hPa high pres will continue to push in from the Great Lakes. This will be associated strong enough pres rises and strengthening pres gradient to maintain gusty W winds which will gradually veer to the NW through the afternoon. Gusts 20-25 mph are likely to linger much of the day. Otherwise, dome of arctic air moves in, with H92 temps dropping to progged mean of -7C with H85 dipping as low as -10C. Mixing may do better than H92 given subsidence inversion remain W of the region. Therefore, highs should approach seasonal normals, in the mid 30s and 40s, especially given the bulk of the snowpack was lost in the warm air today.  Tomorrow night... Good setup for radiational cooling as high pres attempts to crest over the region allowing for weakening sfc winds and clearing skies. Limiting factor will be the lack of snow cover, however H92 temps drop to nearly -11C by 12Z Thu. This should allow for fairly robust inversions. Leaned on coldest available guidance, which was latest MAV/MOS guidance. This yields low teens in the sheltered valleys with upper teens to low 20s elsewhere outside of the urban heat islands.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... Highlights...  * Dry weather but cold on Thursday * Wintry precip possible Friday into Saturday * Unsettled weather chances increasing for the Christmas Holiday  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  An active period ensues for the long term thanks to an amplifying positively tiled longwave trough in the Rockies/Central U.S and a strengthening sub-tropical ridge centered off the coast of Florida. Such a set-up will lead to a strong low/mid-level baroclinic zone stretching from the Gulf Coast States into the Northeast with several waves riding along this zone. This will result in multiple threats for precip chances ranging from wintry weather to heavy rainfall for the end of the week through early next week. Due to the persistent southwesterly upper level flow regime over the Northeast, the region should see temperatures near to even above normal at times during this period. While this overall pattern remains in agreement, the biggest question is the exact location of the baroclinic zone, resulting in thermal differences and exact track of each low pressure system. Details below.  Details...  Thursday...High Confidence.  Canadian high pressure will slide into northern New England on Thursday resulting in dry weather and sunny skies to start. Cloud cover will begin to increase during the later half of the day as WAA begins to move into the area. Otherwise temps will be below average as 850mb temps settle around -8C. This would lead to highs in the upper 20s to low 30s.  Dry weather will prevail Thursday night, but with increase cloud cover, temperatures will remain a bit warmer than Wed PM. Overnight lows in the teens to low 20s.  Friday into Saturday night...Moderate Confidence.  Interesting set-up with a lot of weather factors to consider for this time-period. High pressure to the north with approaching shortwave and low moving towards the Great Lakes, well west of the region. This track means we should see overrunning from the system`s warm front. 12z guidance including the latest EC and UKMET have lean a bit cooler for the onset resulting in a burst of snow during the day on Friday within WAA moving over the surface cold dome over the region. In fact, undercut temperatures on Friday below model guidance as they appear to warm within this pattern. Afterwards, the low`s warm front will begin to lift northward resulting in a surge of warm air in the 925-850mb levels. This combined with cold surface temps thanks to cold air damming from the high to the north could result in a period of ice/freezing rain Friday night into early Saturday. Best chance at this moment appears to be across the interior but just a change in 2m temps will change any p-type for all of southern New England. Will continue to monitor as this could impact Holiday Travel Friday night into Saturday morning.  Warm front will push through mid to late day on Saturday thanks to strong 925mb LLJ reaching near 50-70 kts, 2-3 STD above normal. Once the region warm sectors, guidance is indicating strong mixing which will help many sites warm into the 50s, well above normal. Will have to watch the coastal plain which has a good shot at reaching 60+F which could be close to record highs for PVD. These temps and strong jet aloft, could see wind headlines during the late day as gusts could reach near 40-50+ mph. Still time to evaluate. Otherwise any precip still falling on Saturday will be more in the form of rain thanks to the warm sector.  Cold front will approaching the region Saturday night pushing any leftover precip offshore. Temperatures will cool aloft resulting in overnight temps back down into the 30s.  Sunday into Christmas Day...Low Confidence.  Cold front will push through southern New England early Sunday morning. This front could stall just east of the region putting temps back towards seasonable on Sunday. A weak wave tries to ride along this front which could keep precip chances across the east.  Focus then turns more towards Sunday night into Monday. 12z guidance decided to trend a bit more eastwards resulting in a more cooler solution. Feel the placement on the surface low pressure system and where baroclinic zone will set-up will continue to wobble until guidance can get a better handle on it. Right now the potential for snow and/or wintry precip still exists with rain along the coastal plain. This will change over the coming days so stay tune to the latest forecasts.  Tuesday and beyond...Moderate Confidence.  Upper level trough over the Great Lakes will begin to flatten as high pressure to the south begins to take hold of the CONUS. However, with NW flow aloft, CAA will continue to stream into New England resulting in below average temps and dry weather trends.",

The combination of enhanced lower lvl mixing and dry air entertainment this morning has gradually allowed the trapped mid lvl cloud shield to lift N.

Blustery and colder conditions will move in Wednesday and continue into Thursday. Low pressure will like passes west of the region Friday night and Saturday, which could bring mainly rain and a period of rather mild temperatures along with gusty winds. Another period of unsettled conditions may approach late Saturday night into Christmas Eve, but timing and precipitation types remain uncertain.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...  945 PM Update...  Light spotty warm advection precip lingering over northeast MA at 10 pm. Could be some slippery spots given surface temps here at or just below freezing away from the coastline. This precip will move offshore shortly as mid level short wave kicks east.  Mid level dry air and subsidence follows supporting a dry forecast overnight. However as previous forecaster noted, sufficient low level moisture (dew pts AOA avg nighttime lows) will be trapped beneath this mid level dry air combined with light winds inland, will promote areas of fog. Temps will be at or just below freezing inland so will continue the Special Weather Statement to increase public awareness for the risk of areas of freezing fog and black ice.  Earlier discussion below.   Previous Discussion...  Weak warm front continues to struggle scouring out the cold air which has remained entrenched across S New England, although recently, mainly in the past few hours, have noted a marked increase in sfc dwpts particularly within about 20nm of the S coast suggesting it is starting to shift N. Modest drainage flow, partially thanks to a weak meso-low pres on the new GOES-E is helping to draw some of the colder air across the MA NH/VT border. This has combined with a slight increase in lift through the lower column to enhance saturation in the low lvls and produce some light precip, starting as snow initially.  Through about 03Z (10PM local), as the warm front attempts advancement, a modest warm nose is apparent around H95, which allows temps at this lvl to reach +1C to +2C. This should be enough, even as dry air over tops, to allow for a change to light RA/DZ. Across the N tier, where dwpt depressions remain the largest, temps should remain a few degrees below freezing yielding some light FZRA/FZDZ this evening. This will be most likely along and west of the I-495 corridor in MA, particularly portions of N Worcester, Middlesex and Essex counties away from the coast. Will be continuing an SPS for a light icing risk during the evening commute until dry air infiltrates the warm nose.  The dry air aloft will slowly make its way toward the sfc during the overnight hours, but given trapped near sfc moisture as the sfc reaches near wet-bulb, could be pockets of fog or even freezing fog which may require an overnight expansion of SPS for black ice.  Temps near to slightly above freezing this evening, based in the warm frontal approach. In essence little diurnal cooling this evening.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...  Tomorrow...  Cold front linked to N stream shortwave will be sliding across the region tomorrow. Although drier/cooler air will be gradually filtering in, there remains enough lower lvl moisture for SCT- BKN clouds on occasion through the day. With a slight W-component to the wind, also could see some light SHRA/SHSN in the E slopes of the Berkshires with the frontal passage, but the risk for precip further E remains low thanks to downsloping/drying. By late afternoon, LLJ reaching 35-40 kt at H92 and near 50 kt at H85 should be tapped somewhat, suggesting gusty W winds following the fropa. Temps will be warm comparatively speaking thanks to H92 temps reaching +2C to +3C before the late afternoon fropa. Looking at highs reaching the low-mid 40s.  Tomorrow night...  W winds remain elevated thanks to an evening increase in sfc pres gradient. This should keep winds elevated enough during the overnight hours, that, in spite of clearing skies with a drying column, full decoupling looks unlikely. Min temps drop into the low-mid 30s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...  Highlights...  * Blustery and colder Wed into Thu with dry weather * Mainly rain Fri night/Sat with some wind and mild temps favored * Unsettled weather possible sometime Christmas Eve into Christmas  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  12z guidance is in agreement with the overall pattern. Still some disagreement in exact timing and location of each wave that approaches over the weekend into early next week. Models are locked on to a significant amplification pattern with stout ridge building from the West Coast all the way up into Alaska. Which will result in a mean trough from the Desert Southwest all the way to the Hudson Bay. This set-up will result in a sharp thermal gradient across the southern tier states up into the Northeast, where several waves will ride along. Biggest concern is if southern New England reside on the cold side or the warm side. Right now with the subtropical ridge strongly building, appears the region will be along the warm side of the gradient resulting in above average temperatures for the weekend. Still a lot of uncertainty so stay tuned to the forecast.  Details...  Wednesday into Thursday...High Confidence.  Exiting upper level jet will move offshore as high pressure from the north builds into the region. Strong NW winds will result in CAA to move into the region during the day on Wednesday. Expect highs to be near of slightly below average as temps reach into the mid 30s to low 40s. Blustery northwest winds will continue through much of the day thanks to strong mixing, so it may feel a lot cooler.  High pressure will continue to build north of the region resulting in clearing skies and winds becoming relax during the overnight. This will aid in radiational cooling with low temps dropping back into the teens to single digits.  Southern stream shortwave and low pressure system will remain well to the south of the area by early Thursday morning thanks to high pressure over the region. Regardless, cold airmass will remain overhead as high temps will be in the upper 20s to low 30s. Repeat performance and for chilly lows during the overnight thanks to radiational cooling.   Friday into Saturday...Moderate Confidence.  Warming trend will begin during this period as upper level trough begins to take shape out west and subtropical high strengthens to our southeast. Developing low pressure system across the Midwest into the Great Lakes will bring a weak warm front through on Friday with passing cold front on Saturday. Thermal temperatures will be the main question as this system continues to trend a bit west keeping the region in the warm sector. However with high pressure to the north and weak flow, cold air could remain trapped at the onset of precip leading to some wintry mix/ice for late Friday into Saturday. The thermal profile will warm by Saturday thanks to stout LLJ at 925mb. In fact, both GFS and EC are in agreement with 850mb temps warming to 8-9C for Saturday. Thus expect a transition day on Friday as temps begin to warm into the 40s, with upper 50s to possible 60s on Saturday.  Christmas Eve into Christmas Day...High confidence in trends, lower confidence on exact details.  After the first wave on Friday into Saturday pushes through, a break in the precip Saturday night into Sunday morning. Baroclinic zone will be set-up over the region as Arctic airmass remains across much of the Plains into the Midwest with subtropical ridge to our southeast. Guidance continues to show a few waves of low pressure moving along this boundary resulting in the risk for precip during the this period into early next week. Timing/ptypes and will depend on exactly where the baroclinic zone aligns. Current trends in the guidance as well as ensembles and CIPS analog`s is less snow and more of a rain/ice scenario as thermals will be on the warmer side. Given the strength of southeast upper level ridge.

Seasonably mild conditions becoming breezy tomorrow. Blustery and colder conditions will move in Wednesday and continue into Thursday. Low pressure will like passes west of the region Friday night and Saturday, which could bring mainly rain and a period of rather mild temperatures along with gusty winds. Another period of unsettled conditions may approach late Saturday night into Christmas Eve, but timing and precipitation types remain uncertain.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/... Weak warm front continues to struggle scouring out the cold air which has remained entrenched across S New England, although recently, mainly in the past few hours, have noted a marked increase in sfc dwpts particularly within about 20nm of the S coast suggesting it is starting to shift N. Modest drainage flow, partially thanks to a weak meso-low pres on the new GOES-E is helping to draw some of the colder air across the MA NH/VT border. This has combined with a slight increase in lift through the lower column to enhance saturation in the low lvls and produce some light precip, starting as snow initially.  Through about 03Z (10PM local), as the warm front attempts advancement, a modest warm nose is apparent around H95, which allows temps at this lvl to reach +1C to +2C. This should be enough, even as dry air over tops, to allow for a change to light RA/DZ. Across the N tier, where dwpt depressions remain the largest, temps should remain a few degrees below freezing yielding some light FZRA/FZDZ this evening. This will be most likely along and west of the I-495 corridor in MA, particularly portions of N Worcester, Middlesex and Essex counties away from the coast. Will be continuing an SPS for a light icing risk during the evening commute until dry air infiltrates the warm nose.  The dry air aloft will slowly make its way toward the sfc during the overnight hours, but given trapped near sfc moisture as the sfc reaches near wet-bulb, could be pockets of fog or even freezing fog which may require an overnight expansion of SPS for black ice.  Temps near to slightly above freezing this evening, based in the warm frontal approach. In essence little diurnal cooling this evening.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/... Tomorrow... Cold front linked to N stream shortwave will be sliding across the region tomorrow. Although drier/cooler air will be gradually filtering in, there remains enough lower lvl moisture for SCT- BKN clouds on occasion through the day. With a slight W-component to the wind, also could see some light SHRA/SHSN in the E slopes of the Berkshires with the frontal passage, but the risk for precip further E remains low thanks to downsloping/drying. By late afternoon, LLJ reaching 35-40 kt at H92 and near 50 kt at H85 should be tapped somewhat, suggesting gusty W winds following the fropa. Temps will be warm comparatively speaking thanks to H92 temps reaching +2C to +3C before the late afternoon fropa. Looking at highs reaching the low-mid 40s.  Tomorrow night... W winds remain elevated thanks to an evening increase in sfc pres gradient. This should keep winds elevated enough during the overnight hours, that, in spite of clearing skies with a drying column, full decoupling looks unlikely. Min temps drop into the low-mid 30s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... Highlights...  * Blustery and colder Wed into Thu with dry weather * Mainly rain Fri night/Sat with some wind and mild temps favored * Unsettled weather possible sometime Christmas Eve into Christmas  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  12z guidance is in agreement with the overall pattern. Still some disagreement in exact timing and location of each wave that approaches over the weekend into early next week. Models are locked on to a significant amplification pattern with stout ridge building from the West Coast all the way up into Alaska. Which will result in a mean trough from the Desert Southwest all the way to the Hudson Bay. This set-up will result in a sharp thermal gradient across the southern tier states up into the Northeast, where several waves will ride along. Biggest concern is if southern New England reside on the cold side or the warm side. Right now with the subtropical ridge strongly building, appears the region will be along the warm side of the gradient resulting in above average temperatures for the weekend. Still a lot of uncertainty so stay tuned to the forecast.  Details...  Wednesday into Thursday...High Confidence.  Exiting upper level jet will move offshore as high pressure from the north builds into the region. Strong NW winds will result in CAA to move into the region during the day on Wednesday. Expect highs to be near of slightly below average as temps reach into the mid 30s to low 40s. Blustery northwest winds will continue through much of the day thanks to strong mixing, so it may feel a lot cooler.  High pressure will continue to build north of the region resulting in clearing skies and winds becoming relax during the overnight. This will aid in radiational cooling with low temps dropping back into the teens to single digits.  Southern stream shortwave and low pressure system will remain well to the south of the area by early Thursday morning thanks to high pressure over the region. Regardless, cold airmass will remain overhead as high temps will be in the upper 20s to low 30s. Repeat performance and for chilly lows during the overnight thanks to radiational cooling.   Friday into Saturday...Moderate Confidence.  Warming trend will begin during this period as upper level trough begins to take shape out west and subtropical high strengthens to our southeast. Developing low pressure system across the Midwest into the Great Lakes will bring a weak warm front through on Friday with passing cold front on Saturday. Thermal temperatures will be the main question as this system continues to trend a bit west keeping the region in the warm sector. However with high pressure to the north and weak flow, cold air could remain trapped at the onset of precip leading to some wintry mix/ice for late Friday into Saturday. The thermal profile will warm by Saturday thanks to stout LLJ at 925mb. In fact, both GFS and EC are in agreement with 850mb temps warming to 8-9C for Saturday. Thus expect a transition day on Friday as temps begin to warm into the 40s, with upper 50s to possible 60s on Saturday.  Christmas Eve into Christmas Day...High confidence in trends, lower confidence on exact details.  After the first wave on Friday into Saturday pushes through, a break in the precip Saturday night into Sunday morning. Baroclinic zone will be set-up over the region as Arctic airmass remains across much of the Plains into the Midwest with subtropical ridge to our southeast. Guidance continues to show a few waves of low pressure moving along this boundary resulting in the risk for precip during the this period into early next week. Timing/ptypes and will depend on exactly where the baroclinic zone aligns. Current trends in the guidance as well as ensembles and CIPS analog`s is less snow and more of a rain/ice scenario as thermals will be on the warmer side. Given the strength of southeast upper level ridge. If we do have enough cold air for wintry precipitation, it might end up coming down shallow given rather high height fields which could possibly result in more of an ice threat than snow. Although we all would like a White Christmas, appears that the potential is quickly decreasing.",

Flurries have really struggled to reach the sfc, with the likely issue being the larger magnitude dwpt depressions. Actual values are running about 5-10F drier than guidance, even those going through their 12Z initiation.  These lower dwpts may factor in precip this afternoon and evening, but continue to echo the concern of previous forecaster regarding the risk for FZDZ or even light FZRA as drier air lingers aloft with a gradual moistening of the lower lvls. Sfc temps will be marginal, but close enough for some light accretion especially with some diurnal cooling this evening. No headlines at this time, but will need to consider at least a statement for the afternoon and evening.  Previous Discussion...  Weak warm advection pattern ahead of a warm front will bring risk of spotty light snow to SNE today. Any light snow which will mix or change to rain across eastern New Eng will be spotty this morning. Any accum will be rather light, a coating to a half inch at most, mostly in western New Eng with around an inch in the E slopes of the Berkshires.  The afternoon looks mostly dry but can`t rule out a continued threat of spotty light precip. Low level warming below 900 mb moving up from the south will allow any precip along the south coast to change to rain by midday. As this low level warming advances north, there is a low risk of some spotty freezing rain/drizzle late afternoon/evening in northern and particularly northeast MA where temps remain below freezing, but confidence is low.

A dry cold front will push across the region, with wind shifting from SW to W-NW by around midnight. Colder air works in during the overnight hours. Noting a very strong low level jet, on the order of 35-40 kt at H925 up to 50 kt at H85.

Wednesday and Thursday...  Large Canadian high pressure will build across the region during this timeframe. Blustery NW winds will continue into Wednesday, especially across central and eastern areas as the strong low level jet and very good low level lapse rates will continue. Could see winds continue to gusts up to 25-40 mph through the daylight hours Wednesday, then should diminish Wed night as the low level jet and higher lapse rates move offshore.  The coldest air will push across later Wed and especially Thursday with another surge of cold air. H85 temps will drop back to -8C to -12C by early Thursday morning.

Temperatures will be milder on Tuesday ahead of a cold front, then turn blustery and colder Wednesday into Thursday but with dry weather prevailing. Low pressure will likely pass to our west Friday night and Saturday, probably bringing mainly rain and a period of rather mild temperatures along with some wind. A period of unsettled weather may return sometime Christmas Eve into Christmas, but timing and precipitation types are uncertain.",

Expect light snow to move into western New Eng after midnight with any snowfall more spotty as it reaches eastern MA toward daybreak. Only minor temp drop overnight with increasing cloud cover.  Previous discussion...  Tonight into Monday morning...  ***Light snow will likely impact the Monday morning commute***  Dry weather persists through late evening as mid level cloudiness continues to thicken. Temps will generally range from the teens to middle 20s through midnight.  Increasing potential for light snow showers to develop during the overnight hours and move through southern New England during the morning commute. Low pressure over the Great Lakes will slowly begin to move towards the Northeast pushing the frontal system to our south northward as a warm front. Ahead of the front, isentropic lift within the WAA pattern will help provide just enough lift for precip to occur. Increasing moisture in the mid-levels will help saturate the snow growth region and with soundings keeping the profile below 0C anticipate snow showers. The lift does appear weak thus continued the mention of light snow showers late tonight and into the morning hours.  One thing we will have to watch is the warm layer at 950mb. Both the EC and HRRR are in agreement of thermals which keeps this warm layer just south and west of our area, although it is close. Do not plan on issuing any winter weather advisories at this time for CT or RI. However with the cold temperatures overnight, any snow showers that do occur will accumulate on the roadways just in time for the morning commute. Will issue an SPS to highlight this concern for tomorrow morning. Anyone traveling should take it slow as roads can become slick.

A cold front crosses the region region Tue night into early Wed with colder/blustery weather to follow.  Mainly dry weather anticipated other than perhaps a few brief rain/snow showers across the east slopes of the Berkshires. Increasing wind will keep low temps Tue night mainly in the upper 20s to the lower 30s.

Low temps Wed night should mainly be in the teens, but some single digits can not be ruled out in the normally coldest outlying locations.  High temps on Thu should mainly be in the 30 to 35 degree range, but with less wind than on Wed.  Friday and Saturday...  Upper level ridging will be building across the southeast states as a shortwave trough lifts northeast towards the Great Lakes.  While it is too early to completely lock in a solution...the given pattern and ensemble guidance strongly favors low pressure passing to our northwest putting us on the mild side of the storm.  Timing still uncertain, but most guidance keeps the daytime hours dry with bulk of the rain Friday night and/or Saturday.  Now there initially is still Canadian High pressure which slides off to the east, so can not rule out the low risk for a bit of snow/ice at the onset across the interior. Regardless, mainly rain is favored Friday night into Saturday across the entire region. In fact, temps could climb well into the 50s to near 60 for a time along with a period of strong southerly winds.  Christmas Eve into Christmas...  Very low confidence forecast in this time range.  Upper level ridge with abnormally high height fields will be anchored off the southeast coast.  Meanwhile, a dome of arctic air and well below normal temperatures will be invading much of the central states. This will place our region in the battle ground between these extreme airmasses.  A couple waves of low pressure will likely track along the baroclinic zone and bring the risk for a period or two of precipitation sometime Christmas Eve into Christmas. Timing/ptypes and will depend on exactly where the baroclinic zone aligns.

In fact, East Hawley COOP site dropped to 0 degrees. Temperatures are on the rebound tight now with many sites reaching into the low 20s. Temperatures for today seem to be on track with upper 20s to low 30s for highs thanks to light winds and sunny skies.  To the south, stalled front across the Mid-Atlantic with mid- level moisture streaming along the front. This has resulted in a building cloud deck across the Mid-Atlantic and into NYC. These clouds mark the edge of the WAA and will slowly move northward through the day. While sunny skies will dominate, towards the later half of the day clouds will fill in.  Overall forecast remains on track with just a few minor changes to account for current trends.   Previous Discussion...  Expect a lot of sunshine today, although some high clouds will being to move in from the SW this afternoon. Light NW winds and shallow mixing will result in a cold day. 925 mb temps running from -8C to -10C, so highs will be mostly upper 20s to lower 30s, which is around 10 degrees below normal.",

As low level moisture increases, some patchy light snow is possible, especially in western New Eng. Lows mainly in the teens to lower 20s.  Monday... The weak warm front will lift north into SNE bringing lots of clouds with some light snow possible, especially in the morning. Any snow would change to rain along the south coast as milder air advances northward. Forcing is weak so not much precip and any accum would be limited to a coating to less than an inch. During the afternoon, it looks mostly dry although can`t rule out some spotty light precip given the moist low levels. Given that the ice crystal growth region is fairly moist through the day, any precip would likely be in the form of light snow vs freezing drizzle where temps remain near freezing. It appears the warm front will get hung up near the south coast as a weak wave develops on the front. This will result in a north-south gradient of temps. Highs may climb into the lower 40s near the immediate south coast but cooler as you head north with coldest temps near or a bit below freezing in northern and especially northeast MA.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...

Models then transition around the late Tue as H5 trough begins to dig across central Canada into Hudson Bay, while another long wave trough moves into the Pacific NW. The central Canadian trough progresses across the region Wed, but appears the weak surface reflection will remain far enough N of the region for mainly dry conditions.  Models showing another high amplitude ridge from Alaska south across the eastern Pacific by late this week. As the downstream long wave trough digs from the Great Lakes to the desert SW, noting another short wave in the northern stream flow with another shot of arctic air trying to work south from the North Pole into the northern Plains states into early next weekend. Model solution spread increases, since each member handling this feature somewhat differently, but the GFS/GGEM and ECMWF all appear to have a similar idea in digging a long wave trough across the central U.S. late this week into the holiday weekend, with moderating temperatures possible by Fri-Sat.  A lot of questions with the potential of low pressure and the approach of an arctic front sometime next weekend, but with wide model solution spread due to the timing and track of this potential feature, have low forecast confidence beyond Thursday.  Details...  Monday night and Tuesday...  Temps will hold steady Mon night, mainly in the upper 20s to around 30 away from the coast and lower-mid 30s at the shoreline. With light S-SW wind flow, expect dewpoints close to the temps so will see patchy fog develop as well. For now, have carried a dry forecast Mon night. Can`t rule out some rain and/or snow showers across NW Mass especially across the higher terrain of the northern Berkshires, which may continue into Tuesday but changing over to rain. Expect highs on Tue mainly in the 40s, possibly touching 50 in a few spots along the S coast.  Tuesday night...  As a cold front approaches Tue night, most of the precip will linger across the E slopes of the Berkshires Tue night. Main energy/moisture remains closer to the parent low over central Quebec, so looks like best shot for precip will be well N of the region but can`t rule out a few stray showers mainly across N Mass.  A cold front will cross the region Tue night into early Wed with perhaps a few brief rain/snow showers. High temps will recover well into the 30s to around 40, but a well mixed atmosphere should result in northwest wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph developing Wednesday and making it feel colder.  Wednesday through Thursday night...  The cold front should exit the coast by around 12Z on Wednesday with W-NW winds. Will see excellent low level mixing, so winds will be gusty. Could see gusts up to 30-40 mph Wed afternoon. Highs will range from only 30-35 degrees across the higher inland terrain up to the lower 40s along the immediate coast.  Expect continued dry conditions on Thursday, but it will even colder with highs only in the mid to upper 20s well inland ranging to the lower-mid 30s at the coast. Expect light west winds. CLouds will increase Thu night with a few snow showers reaching into far NW Mass toward daybreak.  Friday and Saturday...  Low confidence forecast continues. As long wave trough digs south out of central Canada into the northern Plains, will see backing mid level steering flow to SW, along with increasing H5 heights. Arctic air starts to push S across Hudson Bay during the weekend, with the arctic cold pool pushing S. So, as high pressure exits Friday morning, leading edge of precip ahead of an approaching warm front will bring light snow during Fri. Should see transition to a mix of sleet and rain during the morning across central and western areas, with temps already above freezing as the precip moves eastward Fri morning.  Some question whether snow or even a little freezing rain may linger across the higher terrain of the northern Berkshires Fri evening, but eventually should change over to all rain with a non-diurnal temp trend Fri night with S-SW wind flow in place. Next question will be how quickly the arctic front will push out of the Mississippi valley into the Appalachians. Wide variance in track and timing of the front toward the region, but at this point should see mainly rain on Saturday with mild temps. Highs look to approach 10 degrees above seasonal normals.",

Highs may climb into the lower 40s near the immediate south coast but cooler as you head north with coldest temps near or a bit below freezing in northern and especially northeast MA.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...  Highlights...  * Dry conditions Monday night into Tuesday, then rain and/or   snow showers across NW Mass Tue afternoon/evening * Mainly dry and much milder Tue * Blustery and colder with mainly dry weather Wed into Thu * A period of snow and/or wintry mix possible Fri morning to   midday, changing to rain  Overview...  00Z model suite continues to signal progressive steering flow across the lower 48 through about the middle of this week as a nearly zonal northern stream flow is in place. Models then transition around the late Tue as H5 trough begins to dig across central Canada into Hudson Bay, while another long wave trough moves into the Pacific NW. The central Canadian trough progresses across the region Wed, but appears the weak surface reflection will remain far enough N of the region for mainly dry conditions.  Models showing another high amplitude ridge from Alaska south across the eastern Pacific by late this week. As the downstream long wave trough digs from the Great Lakes to the desert SW, noting another short wave in the northern stream flow with another shot of arctic air trying to work south from the North Pole into the northern Plains states into early next weekend. Model solution spread increases, since each member handling this feature somewhat differently, but the GFS/GGEM and ECMWF all appear to have a similar idea in digging a long wave trough across the central U.S. late this week into the holiday weekend, with moderating temperatures possible by Fri-Sat.  A lot of questions with the potential of low pressure and the approach of an arctic front sometime next weekend, but with wide model solution spread due to the timing and track of this potential feature, have low forecast confidence beyond Thursday.  Details...  Monday night and Tuesday...  Temps will hold steady Mon night, mainly in the upper 20s to around 30 away from the coast and lower-mid 30s at the shoreline. With light S-SW wind flow, expect dewpoints close to the temps so will see patchy fog develop as well. For now, have carried a dry forecast Mon night. Can`t rule out some rain and/or snow showers across NW Mass especially across the higher terrain of the northern Berkshires, which may continue into Tuesday but changing over to rain. Expect highs on Tue mainly in the 40s, possibly touching 50 in a few spots along the S coast.  Tuesday night...  As a cold front approaches Tue night, most of the precip will linger across the E slopes of the Berkshires Tue night. Main energy/moisture remains closer to the parent low over central Quebec, so looks like best shot for precip will be well N of the region but can`t rule out a few stray showers mainly across N Mass.  A cold front will cross the region Tue night into early Wed with perhaps a few brief rain/snow showers. High temps will recover well into the 30s to around 40, but a well mixed atmosphere should result in northwest wind gusts of 30 to 40 mph developing Wednesday and making it feel colder.  Wednesday through Thursday night...  The cold front should exit the coast by around 12Z on Wednesday with W-NW winds. Will see excellent low level mixing, so winds will be gusty. Could see gusts up to 30-40 mph Wed afternoon. Highs will range from only 30-35 degrees across the higher inland terrain up to the lower 40s along the immediate coast.  Expect continued dry conditions on Thursday, but it will even colder with highs only in the mid to upper 20s well inland ranging to the lower-mid 30s at the coast. Expect light west winds. CLouds will increase Thu night with a few snow showers reaching into far NW Mass toward daybreak.  Friday and Saturday...  Low confidence forecast continues. As long wave trough digs south out of central Canada into the northern Plains, will see backing mid level steering flow to SW, along with increasing H5 heights. Arctic air starts to push S across Hudson Bay during the weekend, with the arctic cold pool pushing S. So, as high pressure exits Friday morning, leading edge of precip ahead of an approaching warm front will bring light snow during Fri. Should see transition to a mix of sleet and rain during the morning across central and western areas, with temps already above freezing as the precip moves eastward Fri morning.  Some question whether snow or even a little freezing rain may linger across the higher terrain of the northern Berkshires Fri evening, but eventually should change over to all rain with a non-diurnal temp trend Fri night with S-SW wind flow in place. Next question will be how quickly the arctic front will push out of the Mississippi valley into the Appalachians. Wide variance in track and timing of the front toward the region, but at this point should see mainly rain on Saturday with mild temps. Highs look to approach 10 degrees above seasonal normals.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/... Overview...  Continue to see a broad, progressive mid level steering flow across most of the lower 48, especially over the northern tier states, while cutoff H5 low tries to set up across the SW states through Monday. Another stronger H5 short wave dives SE out of central Canada by mid week, but the question will be whether some of its associated moisture will work far enough south to bring another round of precipitation across.  Broad long wave ridge moves across the northern tier states by around Thursday as another surface high moves quickly across. Once again, another short wave in the steering flow. An associated warm front may push across late next week as H5 heights rise and winds shift to W-SW. Low pressure may also form across the Great Lakes, with some precip trying to shift E.  Temperatures will start off below seasonal normals early next week, then will briefly warm on Tuesday as the low passes N of the region. Readings drop below normal again around mid week. Beyond Wednesday, models showing a broad model solution spread, so have below average confidence with the forecast.  Details...  Sunday night and Monday...  Weak, elongated short wave moves quickly eastward out of the Ohio Valley, bringing some light precip with it. Still some model solution spread in handling this short wave, with the GFS and NAM being weak and diffuse while both the GGEM and ECMWF are showing a more organized albeit weak low moving across the region with a more robust moisture field. Noting the QPF remains light, with most of the higher amounts pushing in N and W of the region late Sun night and Mon as the surface low moves across northern New England Monday.  Do see the layer moistening up rather well, as seen on both the GFS and NAM BUFKIT soundings, reaching through the dendritic growth zone (which was generally between 850 and 650-700 hPa). So, should see light snow developing across the region by around midnight across central and western areas, pushing E after midnight. At this point, looks like snow amounts will generally be below an inch though some spots could reach an inch across the E slopes of the Berkshires as well as over portions of NE Mass. May see precip taper off to patchy drizzle briefly as the main area shifts E during Monday.  After overnight lows in the upper teens and 20s, expect highs to recover to the 30s across most areas, except 40-45 across the S coast with the continued zonal flow aloft and corresponding H5 heights around 550 dm.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Digging H5 short wave in the W-NW flow across central Canada will dive SE during Tuesday. Associated weak surface low forecast to remain N of the region, but the southern edge of the precip may push into central and northern areas. Light QPF amounts are currently forecast. Temps will moderate, so should see mainly light rain, but could mix with or change to snow showers as it ends early Tue night.  Leftover precip should push offshore during the early morning hours on Wed, then colder air returns with gusty W-NW winds during Wed. Gusts up to around 25 kt are possible during the day, but possibly up to 30 kt across Cape Cod and the islands.  Broad high pressure will cross the region on Thursday with dry conditions and temps running up to 5 degrees below normal.  Thursday night and Friday...  As the high moves offshore Thu night, will start to see a change in the upper level pattern. Another long wave trough will push into the central U.S., extending to the 4 corners region. This will cause the steering flow to shift to W-SW during this timeframe with increasing H5 heights and milder temps toward late next week.  Surface low pres develops the western Lakes, with low level southerly winds bringing moisture to the upper Mississippi valley during Thu. Will still see NW flow early across New England, but as the high moves offshore, winds shift to S-SW. Temps will respond during Fri, with highs ranging from around 40 across the E slopes of the Berkshires into N central Mass up to around 50 along the S coast.  Big question during this timeframe will be whether moisture from off the Carolinas will start to feed N as winds shift ahead of the developing low to the W, bringing some precip along with it. Model solution spread continues, to lower confidence on timing and track of precip.",

A weak warm front may bring some light snow Sunday night and mixed rain/snow Monday. Temperatures will be milder on Tuesday ahead of a cold front, then turning blustery and colder Wednesday into Thursday. As another cold front approaches on Friday, temperatures will moderate again with light rain moving in ahead of another cold front.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  Another northern stream shortwave drops south across New Eng this afternoon. Sunshine will give way to more clouds in the afternoon as area of low and mid level moisture moves into the region ahead of the shortwave. While most of the day will be dry, a few snow showers are possible, mainly in western New Eng where column moisture is a bit greater. The shortwave will also result in some gusty winds today and a reinforcement of the colder airmass with 850 mb temps holding around -12C to -13C. Highs will range from upper 20s to mid 30s. Gusts to 25-30 mph developing.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM SUNDAY/... Tonight... Gusty winds will gradually diminish tonight as high pres approaches from the NW. Good drying moves in which will result in clearing skies although a few high clouds may move in from the SW. Another cold night with lows down into the single numbers in western MA where winds will decouple sooner, with mostly teens elsewhere.  Sunday... High pres builds to the north resulting in light winds but a cold day as 925 mb temps around -8/-9C. With northerly winds and cold start to the day, temps will only recover to the mid 20s to lower 30s, mildest near the south coast. Expect lots of sunshine but high clouds will be increasing in the afternoon.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...  Overview...  Continue to see a broad, progressive mid level steering flow across most of the lower 48, especially over the northern tier states, while cutoff H5 low tries to set up across the SW states through Monday. Another stronger H5 short wave dives SE out of central Canada by mid week, but the question will be whether some of its associated moisture will work far enough south to bring another round of precipitation across.  Broad long wave ridge moves across the northern tier states by around Thursday as another surface high moves quickly across. Once again, another short wave in the steering flow. An associated warm front may push across late next week as H5 heights rise and winds shift to W-SW. Low pressure may also form across the Great Lakes, with some precip trying to shift E.  Temperatures will start off below seasonal normals early next week, then will briefly warm on Tuesday as the low passes N of the region. Readings drop below normal again around mid week. Beyond Wednesday, models showing a broad model solution spread, so have below average confidence with the forecast.  Details...  Sunday night and Monday...  Weak, elongated short wave moves quickly eastward out of the Ohio Valley, bringing some light precip with it. Still some model solution spread in handling this short wave, with the GFS and NAM being weak and diffuse while both the GGEM and ECMWF are showing a more organized albeit weak low moving across the region with a more robust moisture field. Noting the QPF remains light, with most of the higher amounts pushing in N and W of the region late Sun night and Mon as the surface low moves across northern New England Monday.  Do see the layer moistening up rather well, as seen on both the GFS and NAM BUFKIT soundings, reaching through the dendritic growth zone (which was generally between 850 and 650-700 hPa). So, should see light snow developing across the region by around midnight across central and western areas, pushing E after midnight. At this point, looks like snow amounts will generally be below an inch though some spots could reach an inch across the E slopes of the Berkshires as well as over portions of NE Mass. May see precip taper off to patchy drizzle briefly as the main area shifts E during Monday.  After overnight lows in the upper teens and 20s, expect highs to recover to the 30s across most areas, except 40-45 across the S coast with the continued zonal flow aloft and corresponding H5 heights around 550 dm.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Digging H5 short wave in the W-NW flow across central Canada will dive SE during Tuesday. Associated weak surface low forecast to remain N of the region, but the southern edge of the precip may push into central and northern areas. Light QPF amounts are currently forecast. Temps will moderate, so should see mainly light rain, but could mix with or change to snow showers as it ends early Tue night.  Leftover precip should push offshore during the early morning hours on Wed, then colder air returns with gusty W-NW winds during Wed. Gusts up to around 25 kt are possible during the day, but possibly up to 30 kt across Cape Cod and the islands.  Broad high pressure will cross the region on Thursday with dry conditions and temps running up to 5 degrees below normal.  Thursday night and Friday...  As the high moves offshore Thu night, will start to see a change in the upper level pattern. Another long wave trough will push into the central U.S., extending to the 4 corners region. This will cause the steering flow to shift to W-SW during this timeframe with increasing H5 heights and milder temps toward late next week.  Surface low pres develops the western Lakes, with low level southerly winds bringing moisture to the upper Mississippi valley during Thu. Will still see NW flow early across New England, but as the high moves offshore, winds shift to S-SW. Temps will respond during Fri, with highs ranging from around 40 across the E slopes of the Berkshires into N central Mass up to around 50 along the S coast.  Big question during this timeframe will be whether moisture from off the Carolinas will start to feed N as winds shift ahead of the developing low to the W, bringing some precip along with it. Model solution spread continues, to lower confidence on timing and track of precip.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/... Gradually lowering CIGs suggest a slow moistening of the lower lvls. However dwpt depressions at the sfc still running 10-15F at the time of this running. Still, column in the process of moistening to its peak PWATs of 0.5 inches by late this evening. Phasing N and S stream shortwaves still rotating into PA, but the precip shield associated with sfc cyclogenesis beneath a the poleward exit region of of a 170kt jet continues to blossom across PA/NJ and is just reaching S NY state with light SN already reported at NYC to central LI.  The big issue through the evening, particularly 22Z (5PM) through 05Z (midnight) will be how far N this precip shield is able to shift as the low pres and inverted low-mid lvl trof develops through the late evening hours. Although the overnight runs were less progressive and more amplified than previous runs, 15.12Z guidance has split somewhat with the GFS now less amplified than the previous run, the NAM more amplified and the ECMWF/HREF in the middle. Will lean most closely on the latter two. The low lvl dry air will define the initial timing and how far N the precip shield ultimately reaches, but feel that guidance is likely too far suppressed with T-0.01 QPF, as this is similar to the event that occurred yesterday where light SN inched all the way up to along and N of the Mass Pike. Will highlight categorical and likely POPs to this point, dropping to chance and below further N. Peak QPF is along and just S of the S coastal region, in an area where there is modest low-mid lvl banding signature and peak (12-15 microbar/sec) within the -12 C to -18C dendrite growth regime and modest negative EPV. This could be enhanced by a little bit of southerly ocean enhancement, thanks to H85 temps cool to -10C while SSTs hover just below +10C. SLRs will likely be on the higher end within the anomalously cold airmass, looking at about 20:1. Therefore with QPF values in the 0.10-0.30 mark, could see an area of 2-4 inches along the Cape/Islands, with lower amounts across the mainland with a few hours of decent snowfall rates. Band of 1-3 will be featured across S and central CT, most of RI and interior SE MA, with a localized pocket near 4 inch along the immediate S coast. Areas N of this band will likely struggle to reach an inch if even a T is observed.  Hoisting a Winter Wx Advisory for immediate S coastal locations and the Cape/Islands given the risk for some 3+ amounts. Will continue SPS elsewhere. The key with this will be timing, as SN will start during the later portion of the commute, and given cold road sfc temps, should begin to stick quickly where untreated.  Given this is a very progressive system that deepens offshore. SN will quickly end after midnight, giving way to clearing skies through the AM hours such that most areas see the sunrise.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 2 PM THIS AFTERNOON/... 10 am update...  For the most part AM forecast is on track. Will adjust temps/dwpts slightly as obs are running a bit warmer than forecast, likely given that CI is rather thin. This will also yield a slight upward adjustment in afternoon highs. However, still feel most locations will remain in the 20s at their warmest point.  Only other adjustment was an ever so slight delay in POP timing late this afternoon and evening, dwpt depressions are expected to be a bit higher than previously forecast, which will likely delay the onset a bit.  Previous Discussion...  High pres moves offshore this afternoon. Morning sunshine will fade behind increasing clouds this afternoon. Developing low pres emerging off the mid Atlc coast this afternoon but it should remain dry through sunset as deeper moisture still to the south. Just a low risk for a few flurries or light snow developing near the south coast around sunset. 925 mb temps -8 to -9C so another cold day with highs mostly mid-upper 20s with some lower 30s outer Cape/Islands.",

Developing low pres off the mid atlc coast will be tracking NE late today and this evening. Meanwhile, another digging northern stream shortwave will be moving through the Gt Lakes and into the northeast. How these two shortwaves interact will determine how far north and west accumulating snow gets. Models have trended stronger and more amplified with this northern stream shortwave as it is becoming better sampled within the upper air network. This allows the mid level flow to back enough for deeper moisture to move further north and west into SNE.  While the sfc low is tracking southeast of the benchmark, inverted trough extends back to the NW into SNE assocd with approaching northern stream trough. Models showing large scale synoptic forcing ahead of the shortwave along with favorable upper jet dynamics within the left exit region of 170 kt upper jet. Cross sections indicate a period of modest omega within the DGZ this evening, especially across SE New Eng. Given the deep moisture in place, expect a period of light to moderate snow across much of RI and SE MA this evening where snowfall of 1-3 inches is expected with a low risk for a few 4 inch amounts near the south coast and Cape Cod if trough is more amplified. Onset of the snow will be 5-8 pm so part of the evening commute may be impacted. Will let next forecast team examine the 12z model suite to decide whether an advisory is necessary.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... Overview...  Overall steering pattern across the lower 48 transitions to relatively flat mid level flow, which remains progressive even as a long wave trough digs across the western states late this weekend, then trends toward the southern stream as it slowly moves along in the flow. The northern stream remains progressive, with cold temps continuing into early next week. Another H5 trough moves ashore across the Pacific NW Tue night/Wed, with rather good agreement amongst the 00Z model suite. While this moves east through late next week, appears that rising H5 heights as the return SW flow may bring somewhat milder temps to eastern areas toward the end of the period.  Models and ensembles continue to show weak short waves moving across the region in the fast flow aloft, with timing issues coming into play starting early next week as model solution spread increases. Also noting some PTYPE issues as the mid level pattern tries to transition back to near or slightly above normal temps toward the middle of next week.  Details...  Saturday night and Sunday...  As H5 short wave shifts offshore Sat night, will see any leftover precip exit as well. Leftover NW low level jet up to H85 will push offshore. However, will see gusty winds linger Sat evening, up to 25-30 kt. Good low level lapse rates, on order 8-9C/km mainly across central and eastern areas which will allow for good mixing. The lapse rates will drop off between 03Z-06Z as the low level jet also moves offshore, so winds will drop off rather quickly by around midnight. Skies will be mostly clear as temps drop to the single digits and teens, except the upper teens to lower 20s along the immediate coast.  Large high pressure, extending from Quebec down the eastern seaboard, will move across the region late Sat night and Sunday. Light W-NW winds will become variable as ridge axis crosses the during Sunday. Mid and high clouds start to stream across the region Sunday afternoon. It will be another chilly day, with temps remaining below freezing across the interior, reaching to lower-mid 30s along the immediate coast.  Sunday night into Monday...  Some question about next approaching system from the Ohio Valley during this timeframe. Both the GGEM and ECMWF were pretty robust with the development of overrunning precip, while the GFS and NAM keeps the mid level energy rather diffuse in the nearly zonal flow.  Went along with an overall model blend, which has precip developing overnight Sun night and continuing into Monday. Should see some light snow break out, but overall this is another moisture starved system with QPF amounts generally less than 0.1 inches, which yields an inch or less of snow as it mixes with or changes to rain before ending across eastern areas. Have most of the precip pushing offshore Mon afternoon, though timing is in question due to model solution spread with this system.  Monday night through Tuesday night...  Another short wave moves along in the zonal flow, but again more questions about whether there is enough energy and moisture to bring another round of precipitation during this time. Could also see PTYPE issues with this system as low and mid level winds appear to back to S-SW as long wave trough starts to dig across the northern Plains states, with possibly a wintry mix developing late Mon night into early Tue before changing to rain during Tue. Current forecast suggests temps will actually rise during the day, with highs running around 5 degrees above seasonal normals.  Will see the strong low pushing NE across the Great Lakes into Quebec. Attendant cold front should push through, bringing a return to colder temps Tue night.  Wednesday and Thursday...  Blustery and cold conditions return Wed as the strong low will exit into the Maritimes.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Cold and blustery Saturday into Sunday, snow showers possible  - Sunday night into Monday, possible light mixed wintry precip  - Monday night through Tuesday night, warmer first, then cold  - Wednesday into Thursday, return cold and blustery  - Friday onward, monitoring for potential mixed wintry precip events  */ Overview...  Transitional, ebb and flow pattern. Into the following week, strong onshore Pacific push of mild air as the H5 ridge breaks over the NW Pacific, warming over the CONUS, heights rise and bowled colder air over E Canada that has continually wrapped S over the NE CONUS this past week is shunted back N. H5 heights less pronounced, more flat. Impulses riding along the transitional zone, warmer air riding N/E along lingering cold air presents the opportunity of light mixed precip events, exiting quickly with absence of downstream traffic though wrapping up and deepening over offshore regions of better baroclinicity, colder air is drawn S, less pronounced given flatter flow. Again, ebb and flow.  Then interpreting the pattern into the Christmas holiday. As noted yesterday, there`s considerable warming / height rises over N Canada withing the stratosphere as the polar low / night-time jet displace to the other side of the N Hemisphere. This concurrent with a strong push of mild air from the NW Pacific into the Arctic, stout H5 ridge into Alaska, pattern reloads as it buckles downstream over the CONUS into the N Atlantic. But the main polar low over E Canada seemingly pushes E, nudged by the aforementioned positive height anomalies to the W all the way up through the stratosphere. The N Atlantic wide open, looking at a SW-NE transitional zone towards regions favorable for storm development over the N Atlantic into NW Europe. Ejecting energy sheared S over the SW CONUS from the favorable H5 ridge over the NW Pacific, along the SW-NE transitional zone, H85 temperature and parent anomalies from ensemble means showing this well, looking at a pattern favorable over the E CONUS of mixed precip events. With storm development as noted over the N Atlantic, expecting colder air to remain bowled over E/NE Canada, held N up against southwesterlies and positive height / mean sea level pressure anomalies, presumably parent with the positive height anomalies / warmer air surging into the Arctic over Northern N America. Notably N Atlantic surface high builds back W towards the SE CONUS.  Got awhile to make sense of it all. Low confidence forecast by the end of the week into the following weekend. Will hit upon threats / impacts in the discussion below, noting any particular details and touching upon any specifics.  */ Discussion...  Saturday into Sunday...  Cold, blustery, snow shower activity off the Lakes. Storm system departing, deepening downstream Friday night into Saturday, with additional mid-level energy, moisture off the Lakes / over ocean waters, expect blustery winds and cold air advection to contribute to snow shower, potential snow squall activity. Highest confidence of impacts over the Berkshires and across the Outer Cape / Islands. Light accumulations anticipated along with reductions in visibility through Saturday prior to high pressure and colder air into Sunday. Wind gusts Saturday up around 30 to 35 mph forecast, holding below WIND ADVISORY criteria. Still cold wind chills going into Sunday morning with lows in the single digits to teens.  Sunday night into Monday...  Mixed precipitation event. Lifting warm front along which moisture ascends above lingering cold air, albeit weak lift. Not a clear cut scenario. Cold air damming signal via ageostrophic flow light with absence of stronger parent low S/W. Ascent / lift along the warm front being weak and quasi-parallel along isentropes. Ensemble means continue to signal decent 0.01 inch probabilities but now more N/W closer to the parent low collocated with strong SW ascending branch of warm, moist air. Aside from signals of light outcomes and mixed precipitation (snow to sleet to freezing rain), only takes a trace of ice to require WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES. Operational guidance continues to poorly handle the weak wave event yet EC has remained consistent. GFS drier and flatter, little indication of a weak wave disturbance / H85 trof axis.  Monday night into Tuesday night...  Seasonable, dry, SW flow at first prior to a sweeping cold front, perhaps anafrontal, during the overnight period. A flat mid-level feature to accompany, looking at a lack of impacts associated with a potential rain to snow transition. However, operational guidance having difficulties in handling S-stream energy being swept up ahead of the N-stream trof. Separated flow regime or a combination of the sub-tropical with the polar jet. The 14.12z GFS more robust over the concurrent EC. Most GEFS members clustered lower than deterministic guidance. EC ensemble probabilities low with respect to 0.01 inches of liquid.  Wednesday into Thursday...  Lean cold, blustery and dry for Wednesday behind the departing storm system, deepening over SE Canada, drawing S cold air. High pressure for Thursday, a rebound of S flow during the evening ahead of an approaching warm front.  Friday onward...  Signals of a strong synoptic system sweeping the region. Following closely to EC ensemble means, and inside runner, could be dealing with mixed precipitation types out ahead of a lifting warm front, the follow-up sweeping cold front overnight putting us back into colder air as the storm system deepens over SE Canada. From there, the Atlantic high build back W, the amplified pattern emerging over the W CONUS, we get to a SW-NE transitional zone pattern welcoming mixed precipitation / ice events over the E CONUS if ensemble means are correct, gone over in detail in the OVERVIEW section above.",

Cold advection continues to pour into southern New England behind departing ocean low with -18C air at 850 mb upstream across NY state per latest SPC mesoanalysis. Dry weather tonight in response to mid level confluent flow across the region. Beneath this confluent flow high pres builds across the area, resulting in gusty WNW winds this evening diminishing overnight. So cold/dry airmass combined with diminishing wind and a fresh snow cover from south-central CT-RI into southeast MA will yield a cold night ahead. Given the radiational cooling conditions derived mins from the colder MOS and bias corrected MOS datasets. This supports lows in the single digits and teens regionwide!",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...  3 PM update...  Friday...  Cold start to the day but fortunately not much wind. Some dim morning sunshine possible behind increasing mid/high clouds. This combined with cold airmass remaining in place over the area with 850 mb temps around -12C, not expecting much of a temp recovery. Highs only 25-30 with warmest readings along the south coast and coldest across the high terrain.  Friday evening and overnight...  Then toward evening another vigorous northern stream short wave approaches southern New England from the west. Parent low tracks from Ontario to Quebec. However this short wave induces cyclogenesis off the Mid Atlc coast but races ENE south of the benchmark given the fast/progressive upper air pattern. Will have to watch and see if this short wave trends stronger and backs the mid level flow more along the eastern seaboard. This would result in deep moisture and lift tracking closer to the coast into southeast MA Friday evening. All model guid indicate trough amplification just east of Cape Cod with increasing mid/upper level Q-vector convergence. In addition mid level lapse rates begin to steepen too. If later model runs are 6 hrs quicker with trough amplification a few inches of snow would be possible over southeast MA, possibly eastern MA. However for now will follow a model blend which offers a period of light snow/flurries with snow accums less than an inch.  Drying trend by midnight along with a reinforcing surge of cold air advection via blustery WNW winds on the backside of this departing wave.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...  3 PM update...  */ Highlights...   - Cold and blustery Saturday into Sunday, snow showers possible  - Sunday night into Monday, possible light mixed wintry precip  - Monday night through Tuesday night, warmer first, then cold  - Wednesday into Thursday, return cold and blustery  - Friday onward, monitoring for potential mixed wintry precip events  */ Overview...  Transitional, ebb and flow pattern. Into the following week, strong onshore Pacific push of mild air as the H5 ridge breaks over the NW Pacific, warming over the CONUS, heights rise and bowled colder air over E Canada that has continually wrapped S over the NE CONUS this past week is shunted back N. H5 heights less pronounced, more flat. Impulses riding along the transitional zone, warmer air riding N/E along lingering cold air presents the opportunity of light mixed precip events, exiting quickly with absence of downstream traffic though wrapping up and deepening over offshore regions of better baroclinicity, colder air is drawn S, less pronounced given flatter flow. Again, ebb and flow.  Then interpreting the pattern into the Christmas holiday. As noted yesterday, there`s considerable warming / height rises over N Canada withing the stratosphere as the polar low / night-time jet displace to the other side of the N Hemisphere. This concurrent with a strong push of mild air from the NW Pacific into the Arctic, stout H5 ridge into Alaska, pattern reloads as it buckles downstream over the CONUS into the N Atlantic. But the main polar low over E Canada seemingly pushes E, nudged by the aforementioned positive height anomalies to the W all the way up through the stratosphere. The N Atlantic wide open, looking at a SW-NE transitional zone towards regions favorable for storm development over the N Atlantic into NW Europe. Ejecting energy sheared S over the SW CONUS from the favorable H5 ridge over the NW Pacific, along the SW-NE transitional zone, H85 temperature and parent anomalies from ensemble means showing this well, looking at a pattern favorable over the E CONUS of mixed precip events. With storm development as noted over the N Atlantic, expecting colder air to remain bowled over E/NE Canada, held N up against southwesterlies and positive height / mean sea level pressure anomalies, presumably parent with the positive height anomalies / warmer air surging into the Arctic over Northern N America. Notably N Atlantic surface high builds back W towards the SE CONUS.  Got awhile to make sense of it all. Low confidence forecast by the end of the week into the following weekend. Will hit upon threats / impacts in the discussion below, noting any particular details and touching upon any specifics.  */ Discussion...  Saturday into Sunday...  Cold, blustery, snow shower activity off the Lakes. Storm system departing, deepening downstream Friday night into Saturday, with additional mid-level energy, moisture off the Lakes / over ocean waters, expect blustery winds and cold air advection to contribute to snow shower, potential snow squall activity. Highest confidence of impacts over the Berkshires and across the Outer Cape / Islands. Light accumulations anticipated along with reductions in visibility through Saturday prior to high pressure and colder air into Sunday. Wind gusts Saturday up around 30 to 35 mph forecast, holding below WIND ADVISORY criteria. Still cold wind chills going into Sunday morning with lows in the single digits to teens.  Sunday night into Monday...  Mixed precipitation event. Lifting warm front along which moisture ascends above lingering cold air, albeit weak lift. Not a clear cut scenario. Cold air damming signal via ageostrophic flow light with absence of stronger parent low S/W. Ascent / lift along the warm front being weak and quasi-parallel along isentropes. Ensemble means continue to signal decent 0.01 inch probabilities but now more N/W closer to the parent low collocated with strong SW ascending branch of warm, moist air. Aside from signals of light outcomes and mixed precipitation (snow to sleet to freezing rain), only takes a trace of ice to require WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES. Operational guidance continues to poorly handle the weak wave event yet EC has remained consistent. GFS drier and flatter, little indication of a weak wave disturbance / H85 trof axis.  Monday night into Tuesday night...  Seasonable, dry, SW flow at first prior to a sweeping cold front, perhaps anafrontal, during the overnight period. A flat mid-level feature to accompany, looking at a lack of impacts associated with a potential rain to snow transition. However, operational guidance having difficulties in handling S-stream energy being swept up ahead of the N-stream trof. Separated flow regime or a combination of the sub-tropical with the polar jet. The 14.12z GFS more robust over the concurrent EC. Most GEFS members clustered lower than deterministic guidance. EC ensemble probabilities low with respect to 0.01 inches of liquid.  Wednesday into Thursday...  Lean cold, blustery and dry for Wednesday behind the departing storm system, deepening over SE Canada, drawing S cold air. High pressure for Thursday, a rebound of S flow during the evening ahead of an approaching warm front.  Friday onward...  Signals of a strong synoptic system sweeping the region. Following closely to EC ensemble means, and inside runner, could be dealing with mixed precipitation types out ahead of a lifting warm front, the follow-up sweeping cold front overnight putting us back into colder air as the storm system deepens over SE Canada. From there, the Atlantic high build back W, the amplified pattern emerging over the W CONUS, we get to a SW-NE transitional zone pattern welcoming mixed precipitation / ice events over the E CONUS if ensemble means are correct, gone over in detail in the OVERVIEW section above.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... Overview...  Overall, noting an active, progressive pattern in place across the lower 48, especially starting this weekend as the blocking high amplitude ridge across the western U.S. breaks down. This will bring weak mid level short waves eastward in the fast flow aloft. After several days of below normal temperatures, models continue to signal milder air starting to move into the northeast early next week.  With any progressive pattern, however, noting widening model solution spread with the timing and track of weather systems especially across the northern stream, so have lower confidence with the track and timing of any systems beyond Monday.  For now, will see a couple of weak lows passing near or SE of New England into this weekend, each bringing some light rain and/or snow showers but will move across rather quickly. As the upper pattern becomes nearly zonal, will start to see temperatures moderating closer to seasonal normals by early next week, though may still see some light precip into mid week mainly along coastal areas and across the E slopes of the Berkshires.  Details...  Friday night and Saturday...  Light precipitation along the western periphery of low pressure moving well SE of the 40N/70W benchmark brings scattered snow showers Friday night. At this point, the best chance will occur along the immediate S coast, Cape Cod and the islands. Current timing suggests that the precip should push offshore by Sat morning. With light QPF amounts, less than 0.1 inches, should see less than an inch snow accumulations.  As the low exits, W-NW winds will pick up as low level lapse rates increase during Saturday. Could see gusts up to 25-35 kt, highest across SE areas where the highest low level jet moves across. With temps running up to 10 degrees below seasonal normals, will see wind chill values in the teens to lower 20s during the day.  Sunday and Monday...  High pres ridge builds east across the eastern seaboard by Sunday morning, so winds will diminish by daybreak. Will see another cold day, however, as mid level winds continue from the NW, though will start to back to W later in the day. Another chilly day with highs from the mid-upper 20s across the higher inland terrain to the 30s across the coastal plain.  A weak warm front will approach Sunday night, so may see some overrunning precip try to develop across western by around 00Z Monday, then pushing E quickly through the night and during Monday. Temps will hold mainly in the 20s except the lower-mid 30s along the immediate coast overnight as the precip develops. Thermal profiles suggest mainly light snow Sun night, but not a lot of precip to work with so not expect much in the way of snow accumulations at this point.  As winds shift to SW, will see milder air finally push into the region. Expect spotty snow showers to change to rain during the morning, but may linger a bit longer across the higher inland terrain. Expect highs close to seasonal normals for mid December.  Tuesday and Wednesday...  With a nearly zonal mid level steering flow across most of the country, will see weak systems work eastward but tend to weaken as they approach.

This results in surface low jumping from near Cleveland at 06z to redeveloping south of Long Island 12z Thu and tracking east along the 40N parallel during the day. Good model agreement that modest omega (15 -ubar/s) occurs in the DGZ (snow growth layer of -10C to -20C) 12z-15z Thu along the immediate south coast and Islands. Thus should see at least modest size flakes (dendrites) which will help reduce vsby and yield an efficient snow system with 15-1 snow ratios. In addition, models suggest some instability in this layer too in the form of -epv. So the combination of modest synoptic scale lift, good Fgen in snow growth layer may result in this system over performing.

Furthermore, system is very progress which leaves just a 1-3 hr window for moderate snowfall. Thus have leaned toward a 1-3 inch snowfall for immediate south coast and islands with impact to the morning commute from Westerly to Newport to New Bedford to Cape Cod. Given cold antecedent conditions snow will immediately stick to all surfaces. Will have to see how 00z models trend as these systems sometime trend northward. This would result in accumulating snow possibly as for north as Hartford to Providence to Plymouth. Nonetheless there will be a very sharp cutoff on the northern edge of the snow shield.  Given trough is very progressive expecting sunshine to develop during the afternoon. Still colder than normal with highs only in the upper 20s and lower 30s. Not nearly as windy as today but still a chilly day.  Thursday night...  Becoming blustery during the evening behind departing low. However winds drop off late as weak high pres builds in.

This results in surface low jumping from near Cleveland at 06z to redeveloping south of Long Island 12z Thu and tracking east along the 40N parallel during the day. Good model agreement that modest omega (15 -ubar/s) occurs in the DGZ (snow growth layer of -10C to -20C) 12z-15z Thu along the immediate south coast and Islands. Thus should see at least modest size flakes (dendrites) which will help reduce vsby and yield an efficient snow system with 15-1 snow ratios.

Cyclonic flow aloft combined with some lake effect moisture will generate SCT-BKN cumulus clouds across the area along with a few snow showers/flurries especially across the upslope areas of the high terrain of western MA. Ocean effect snows will continue off the south coast of RI/MA but should only clip Nantucket given the WNW low level trajectory. Previous forecast captures these details nicely so no major changes with this update.  Previous Discussion...  Mid level low moves across New Eng this morning before lifting NE this afternoon. Cold pool aloft with 500 mb temps around -32C combined with some low and mid level moisture moving through will lead to a period of bkn cu and can`t rule out a few flurries, especially higher terrain. Clearing later afternoon.  The main weather story for today will be wind and cold in the wake of the departing low pres moving into the Maritimes. 850 mb temps bottom out around -15C to -16C today so only expect minor recovery from morning lows. Highs will range through the 20s to near 30 outer Cape/Islands, with some upper teens in the Berkshires. Wind chills will be in the single numbers and teens. Well mixed boundary layer with steep low level lapse rates will promote excellent mixing with soundings suggesting peak gusts 40-50 mph, strongest mid/late afternoon especially over higher elevations. We expanded the wind advisory to include all of MA/RI.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM THURSDAY/... A period of clear skies expected this evening with gusty winds gradually diminishing overnight. However, clouds will quickly return as a rather robust mid level shortwave moves across the Ohio Valley to south of New Eng late tonight and early Thu. Low pres tracks south of the coast and attempts to spread some light snow north into portions of SNE late tonight into early Thu. Plenty of dry air initially to overcome which will limit northward extent of snowfall. Best chance for a period of light snow will be near the south coast and especially the Islands where better moisture and lift. Guidance indicating a brief period of modest omega in the DGZ over the Islands 09z-12z with sharp decrease in omega to the north. Minor accum of a coating to an inch is possible for the south coast and especially the Islands with low prob for 2 inches BID-ACK. However, a sharp gradient is expected on the northern edge of the snow shield so if it shifts slightly south, little or no accum will be the result.  Light snow may linger into Thu morning immediate south coast and especially Cape/Islands as low pres passes to the south. Otherwise, drier air and clearing skies behind the departing low pres will gradually move in from NW to SE but it may take until mid afternoon for clearing to reach far SE New Eng. A period of gusty NW winds will develop Thu afternoon with gusts 20-30 mph. Another unseasonably cold day with highs mid 20s to lower 30s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... Overview...  Mid level pattern remains active but progressive across the lower 48 through this period. High amplitude pattern continues late this week, with cutoff H5 low pressure across eastern Canada. Another mid level short wave will push out of the Great Lakes late this week into the weekend. Models continue to signal some southern stream energy and moisture trying to work up the eastern seaboard Fri night into Sat, and may see some moisture try to link up with the short wave. Model solution spread lends to lower confidence with this aspect of the forecast.  The amplified mid level pattern forecasted to break down late this week into the weekend, with the western ridge flattening out and the H5 cutoff out of Ontario breaking down as it shifts E. The steering flow then opens up, keeping systems moving cross country while the western ridge may try to re-orient over the eastern Pacific by the end of the period.  As for temperatures, expect the coldest air across the region Thu night into Sat, with H85 temps running from -10C to -15C for a good portion of this period. With the pattern change, the mid level steering flow flattens out which will allow temps to moderate with a more westerly flow by late in the weekend into early next week. Temps will trend close to normal into the beginning of the work week.  Used a blend of available guidance through Saturday, then trended toward an ensemble blend through the remainder of the period.  Details...  Thursday night... Expect mainly clear and cold conditions Thu night as high pres builds E out of the Ohio Valley. Leftover W-NW winds gusting to 20- 25 kt Thu evening will diminish as the pres gradient relaxes, though some higher gusts will linger along the immediate coast. Clouds will start to increase from the S during the early morning hours.  With H85 temps in the -10C to -15C range, will see surface temps bottom out in the single digits and teens except lingering in the lower 20s across the outer Cape and Nantucket.  Friday through Saturday... H5 short wave and surface reflection will slide E out of the Great Lakes, so clouds will continue to increase. Another low and southern stream energy tries to develop off the mid Atlc coast Fri afternoon and, as winds shift to light S-SW, some low level moisture will reach into central and southern areas by late in the day. Best shot for scattered snow showers looks to occur along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands Fri night into Sat.  The system out of the Lakes will push E, with most of what`s left of its energy pushing across northern New England. However, some leftover moisture could reach the E slopes of the Berkshires Fri night through about midday Sat before dissipating. Have slight chance to low chance POPs going there.  As the coastal low exits by midday Sat, pressure gradient tightens again as high pres pushes E. Will see W-NW winds become gusty once again, upwards to 20-25 mph. So, even with slight milder temps, wind chill values will range from the single digits across the higher terrain to around 20 along the immediate coast by Sat afternoon.  Highs on Friday will remain below freezing for most areas, except may reach the lower-mid 30s along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands. It will be a bit milder on Saturday, with highs from the mid 20s across the higher terrain to the lower-mid 30s across the coastal plain.  Saturday night... High pressure ridge will build across the eastern seaboard, so expect mainly mostly clear skies. Some gusty winds will linger Sat evening then diminish, but it will be another cold night. Expect low temps in the teens for most areas, except in the 20s along the immediate coast and islands.  Sunday and Sunday night... As the high ridge shifts E, winds shift to S-SW which will bring a bit milder air northward. However, will also see moisture ahead of an approaching warm front moving NE. At this point, looks like precip will start off as snow showers Sunday afternoon, mixing with rain at times before changing to snow showers Sun night. Not a whole lot of moisture expect with this system. Some question how fast the warm front moves amongst the model suite.  Monday and Tuesday... At this point, the front should push offshore Monday, but again rather wide model solution spread with the departing low. Not a lot of cold air behind the front, though, as a nearly zonal flow at the surface and aloft in place through Tue. Current forecasted temps suggest readings close to seasonal levels during this timeframe.",

A fast moving low pressure will track south of New England late tonight and early Thursday bringing a period of light snow to the south coast and especially the Islands. Another low pressure may bring some light snow around Friday night then cold and dry for Saturday. Somewhat milder temperatures return on Sunday.",

Cold pool aloft with 500 mb temps around -32C combined with some low and mid level moisture moving through will lead to a period of bkn cu and can`t rule out a few flurries, especially higher terrain. Clearing later afternoon.  The main weather story for today will be wind and cold in the wake of the departing low pres moving into the Maritimes. 850 mb temps bottom out around -15 to -16C today so only expect minor recovery from morning lows. Highs will range through the 20s to near 30 outer Cape/Islands, with some upper teens in the Berkshires. Wind chills will be in the single numbers and teens. Well mixed boundary layer with steep low level lapse rates will promote excellent mixing with soundings suggesting peak gusts 40-50 mph, strongest mid/late afternoon especially over higher elevations. We expanded the wind advisory to include all of MA/RI.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM THURSDAY/... A period of clear skies expected this evening with gusty winds gradually diminishing overnight. However, clouds will quickly return as a rather robust mid level shortwave moves across the Ohio Valley to south of New Eng late tonight and early Thu. Low pres tracks south of the coast and attempts to spread some light snow north into portions of SNE late tonight into early Thu. Plenty of dry air initially to overcome which will limit northward extent of snowfall. Best chance for a period of light snow will be near the south coast and especially the Islands where better moisture and lift. Guidance indicating a brief period of modest omega in the DGZ over the Islands 09z-12z with sharp decrease in omega to the north. Minor accum of a coating to an inch is possible for the south coast and especially the Islands with low prob for 2 inches BID-ACK. However, a sharp gradient is expected on the northern edge of the snow shield so if it shifts slightly south, little or no accum will be the result.  Light snow may linger into Thu morning immediate south coast and especially Cape/Islands as low pres passes to the south. Otherwise, drier air and clearing skies behind the departing low pres will gradually move in from NW to SE but it may take until mid afternoon for clearing to reach far SE New Eng. A period of gusty NW winds will develop Thu afternoon with gusts 20-30 mph. Another unseasonably cold day with highs mid 20s to lower 30s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...  Overview...  Mid level pattern remains active but progressive across the lower 48 through this period. High amplitude pattern continues late this week, with cutoff H5 low pressure across eastern Canada. Another mid level short wave will push out of the Great Lakes late this week into the weekend. Models continue to signal some southern stream energy and moisture trying to work up the eastern seaboard Fri night into Sat, and may see some moisture try to link up with the short wave. Model solution spread lends to lower confidence with this aspect of the forecast.  The amplified mid level pattern forecasted to break down late this week into the weekend, with the western ridge flattening out and the H5 cutoff out of Ontario breaking down as it shifts E. The steering flow then opens up, keeping systems moving cross country while the western ridge may try to re-orient over the eastern Pacific by the end of the period.  As for temperatures, expect the coldest air across the region Thu night into Sat, with H85 temps running from -10C to -15C for a good portion of this period. With the pattern change, the mid level steering flow flattens out which will allow temps to moderate with a more westerly flow by late in the weekend into early next week. Temps will trend close to normal into the beginning of the work week.  Used a blend of available guidance through Saturday, then trended toward an ensemble blend through the remainder of the period.  Details...  Thursday night... Expect mainly clear and cold conditions Thu night as high pres builds E out of the Ohio Valley. Leftover W-NW winds gusting to 20- 25 kt Thu evening will diminish as the pres gradient relaxes, though some higher gusts will linger along the immediate coast. Clouds will start to increase from the S during the early morning hours.  With H85 temps in the -10C to -15C range, will see surface temps bottom out in the single digits and teens except lingering in the lower 20s across the outer Cape and Nantucket.  Friday through Saturday... H5 short wave and surface reflection will slide E out of the Great Lakes, so clouds will continue to increase. Another low and southern stream energy tries to develop off the mid Atlc coast Fri afternoon and, as winds shift to light S-SW, some low level moisture will reach into central and southern areas by late in the day. Best shot for scattered snow showers looks to occur along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands Fri night into Sat.  The system out of the Lakes will push E, with most of what`s left of its energy pushing across northern New England. However, some leftover moisture could reach the E slopes of the Berkshires Fri night through about midday Sat before dissipating. Have slight chance to low chance POPs going there.  As the coastal low exits by midday Sat, pressure gradient tightens again as high pres pushes E. Will see W-NW winds become gusty once again, upwards to 20-25 mph. So, even with slight milder temps, wind chill values will range from the single digits across the higher terrain to around 20 along the immediate coast by Sat afternoon.  Highs on Friday will remain below freezing for most areas, except may reach the lower-mid 30s along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands. It will be a bit milder on Saturday, with highs from the mid 20s across the higher terrain to the lower-mid 30s across the coastal plain.  Saturday night... High pressure ridge will build across the eastern seaboard, so expect mainly mostly clear skies. Some gusty winds will linger Sat evening then diminish, but it will be another cold night. Expect low temps in the teens for most areas, except in the 20s along the immediate coast and islands.  Sunday and Sunday night... As the high ridge shifts E, winds shift to S-SW which will bring a bit milder air northward. However, will also see moisture ahead of an approaching warm front moving NE. At this point, looks like precip will start off as snow showers Sunday afternoon, mixing with rain at times before changing to snow showers Sun night. Not a whole lot of moisture expect with this system. Some question how fast the warm front moves amongst the model suite.  Monday and Tuesday... At this point, the front should push offshore Monday, but again rather wide model solution spread with the departing low. Not a lot of cold air behind the front, though, as a nearly zonal flow at the surface and aloft in place through Tue. Current forecasted temps suggest readings close to seasonal levels during this timeframe.",

    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Strong low pressure will spin across the Maritimes into Labrador through Wednesday night, continuing a strong surge of arctic air into our region. While the core of this arctic air remains north of our region, will see increasing W-NW winds with the sharp pressure gradient. 0-3 km lapse rates are near dry adiabatic, meaning excellent mixing and momentum transfer. Will probably need a Wind Advisory for portions of southern New England, especially across the higher terrain and towards the coasts. Still trying to refine the area and timing a bit more.  Some leftover snow showers may linger across the E slopes of the Berkshires through midday Wednesday, with a few lingering along the S coast early.

A few locations towards the Berkshires could see subzero wind chills Wednesday afternoon.  Winds diminish some Wednesday night as better mixing moves offshore. Another mid level shortwave should pass by to our south. While this should mean some clouds for our region, temperatures will still fall into the teens away from the immediate coast. Lows in the 20s for there. Still very low wind chills in the single digits and teens for much of the region, with readings as low as -5 toward daybreak across the E slopes of the Berkshires.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Skirting clipper low with light snow Thursday  - Cold and dry Thursday night into Friday  - Another shot of snow shower activity going into Friday night  - Cold and dry again for Saturday  - Potential wintry mix event for Sunday  - Early on cold, light snow followed by a warmer trend next week  */ Overview...  Cold, active weather pattern persists into the weekend, beginning to relax into the following week. H5 trof pattern maintains over NE N America round which disturbances rotate, at times capturing S-stream energy, quickly escaping E with lesser downstream traffic. Looking at a series of clipper systems which will bring periods of wintry weather followed by gusty winds that aid in preserving the below- average temperature pattern we have seen as of late. Strength of individual disturbances is in question which will be broken down below, however their forecast quick movement and short residency, looking at brief impacts and leaning towards less impressive / deep storm development in vicinity of New England. Certain they`ll keep on reloading negative H85 temperature anomalies across the region.  But perhaps a warming trend towards late December? The wave breaking over the NW Pacific as a stout jet of milder air pushes E into W N America, colder air is shunted back N as the H5 pattern across the CONUS relaxes, becoming more zonal. While still within the periphery of the polar jet, seemingly looking at a return of an ebb and flow pattern with a nod towards shots of cooler air out of the N rather than S-stream dominance.  Continued confidence in operational forecast guidance out through 72-96 hours, thereafter preference to ensemble means. Wintry weather followed by cold and blustery themes into the weekend then a gradual warm-up into next week with potential for mixed precip events early on.  */ Discussion...  Thursday...  Skirting clipper low, potential for wintry weather. Consensus of forecast guidance has a near-miss, the crux of the forcing offshore associated with positive differential vorticity advection, stronger ascent of greater moisture availability. However, evaluation along isentropes and the environment within the snow growth region, there are indications of weak lift and available moisture along decent SW to NE frontogenetical banding around H7-5. Can not rule out light snow chances spreading as far N/W of the MA/VT/NH border. Not sold on just saying zero based on synoptics. Consensus of guidance has the dry, subsiding wedge further N over N New England. Thus like to keep chance PoPs for all of S New England, likely along the S coast. Amounts light, thinking little impact. The EPS probabilities paint a decent picture of outcomes with respect to 24-hour 0.01 liquid. A mainly early-half of the day event, tapering into afternoon/eve. Nantucket having the best shot of seeing appreciable accumulation of precipitation.  Late Thursday into Thursday night...  Cold and dry. Initially blustery, storm system quickly steering out as high pressure builds in. Gales briefly on the waters, all else being good. Flirting with noteworthy wind chills yet seemingly prior to the crux of cold air with single digit lows into Friday morning. That being said any liquid from melt along roads will easily freeze.  Friday into Friday night...  Possible snow shower activity, otherwise maintained cold. Positively-tilted H5 trof axis quickly sweeping across the region yields little threat and impact to the region. Moisture present but lacking deep synoptic lift. Agree with the bulk of development across the better baroclinic zone well offshore as the H5 trof undergoes neutral tilt out across the Atlantic. Lack of mid-upper level curvature until further downstream. Chance PoPs with energy transfer from N-stream clipper to S-stream wave along the better baroclinic zone. Mainly snow showers and looking at light accumulations.  Saturday into Saturday night...  Blustery and cold. High pressure settling in behind exiting storm, would expect ocean-effect stratus / showers near the coast, perhaps some Lake effect snow shower activity getting into N/W MA before deeper subsidence and drier air builds in.  Sunday into Sunday night...  Potential mixed precip storm. Monitoring cold air damming as there is the possibility of over-running precipitation. Gradually warming as the warm front lifts N but also as the dry slot seemingly wraps in, looking at potential change overs before all is said and done. Too early to get on particulars but something to watch.  Into next week...  Some final clipper systems, shots of cold, then the warming trend begins as we get back into an ebb and flow pattern. With clipper and cold, the usual shot of snow shower activity enhanced by the Lakes, followed by blustery winds and the typical offshore ocean-effect stratus / shower activity.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/... *** A Wintry Mix Across The Interior This Morning ***  1028 AM update...  Surface temperatures continue to slowly rise above freezing for portions of southern New England. Cold air damming evident at the usual suspects, particularly in the lower CT River valley and north central MA. Will need to monitor temperatures closely over the next few hours. Current thinking is the timing on the Winter Weather Advisory is fairly good. The timing may need some later tweaking.  Otherwise, tweaked the ongoing forecast to reflect observed trends and timing.  Previous Discussion...  Significant trough amplification occurs today over the eastern Great Lakes, with mid level trough taking on a negative tilt tonight before closing off to a 506 dam low over western MA by 12z Wed. For this morning, a modest cold airmass in place over southern New England with temps below freezing inland and dew pts down to 16F at Worcester. 1020 mb high over Maine early this morning builds to about 1026 mb later today in response to upstream trough amplification. This will provide cold air damming into interior MA and possibly farther south into northern CT and northwest RI.  Column is cold enough to support snow. However developing low level southeast jet provides strong WAA and will result in snow changing over to rain quickly in the coastal plain. However northwest MA will have the longest duration of snow and could be moderate to perhaps heavy for a time this morning toward 15z. In addition, mid level lapse rates approach 6.5-7C/KM combined with bulk of forcing for ascent occurring in the snow growth region yields the risk for a period of moderate to heavy snow 12z-15z. Thus this event could overperform a bit across northwest MA where a brief period of moderate to heavy snow could produce 1-3\" snowfall amounts FROM 12Z- 15Z, possibly a few 4 or 5 inches in northwest Franklin county.  Otherwise most locations will see snow quickly change to rain this morning as warm nose at 925 mb advects across the area. The issue will be across the interior (along and northwest of I-90 and I-495) where shallow cold air will be stubborn to dislodge. This will result in a period of freezing rain/ice. A shorter duration of freezing rain/ice is possible farther south across northern CT, northwest RI into the I-495 corridor. Given current temps remain below freezing across interior Essex county along with dew pts in the low 20s and winds calm, we`ll expand winter weather advisory to this region for a brief period of mixed wintry precip 7 am - 10 am. Keep in mind it doesn`t take much freezing rain/ice to result in slippery travel.  Farther south into the coastal plain including Boston and Providence, any snow will quickly changeover to rain given increasing southeast winds. Rain will likely be heavy at times this afternoon given trough amplification/strong jet dynamics with LFQ of upper level jet streak overspreading the area, enhancing QG forcing. In addition some instability aloft with mid level lapse rates increasing to 6.5-7.0C/KM (TTs 50-55). This combined with fairly strong forcing may result in embedded convection, enhancing rainfall potential.  It will become breezy along the eastern MA coast especially Cape Ann as low level jet increases as it departs offshore. This low level jet will warm the coastal plain to 45-50 degs this afternoon, this includes the Boston to Providence corridor. Meanwhile farther inland late day highs of 35-40.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 AM WEDNESDAY/... Early morning update...  Vigorous negatively tilted short wave trough approaches from the southwest.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... Overview...  Deep H5 long wave trough sets up by mid week from the Arctic Circle southward to the mid Atlantic coast, while high amplitude ridge continues from the Northwest Territories through the Pacific Coast. This will bring the coldest air so far this season to the region along with strong W-NW winds through Thursday.  As the cold pool retreats into eastern Canada late this week, appears that the western ridge may break down as a short wave moves into the Pacific NW late Fri or Sat. Also noting a weak mid level short wave that may wrap around base of the eastern Canadian cutoff low and cross the region. May also see a strengthening southern stream system try to ride up across the western Atlantic. Rather wide model solution spread at this point, so track is in question along with the possibility of the northern fringe of the precip shield approaching portions of the south coast late in the week or into the weekend. 00Z GFS is farthest W with this system, while the Canadian GGEM is further offshore. Something to keep an eye on.  With rather wide solution spreads amongst the model suite from about Friday into early next week, lower forecast confidence for this portion of the forecast.  Will use a blend of available model guidance into Friday, then transition over the model ensembles for the latter portion of this period.  Details...  Wednesday and Wednesday night...  Strong low pressure will spin across the Maritimes into Labrador through Wednesday night, bringing a strong surge of arctic air to the region. Noting H85 temps dropping through the day, due to -12C to -16C by 00Z Thu. While the core of the arctic air remains N of the region, will see increasing W-NW winds with the sharp pressure gradient across the region from the eastern Canadian vortex. Noting H85 jet up to 40-50 kt moving across the region by Wed afternoon, with excellent low level lapse rates, so will see a good chunk of these winds mixing down. Could see gusts up to 40-50 mph during Wed, so wind advisory headlines will probably be needed.  Some leftover snow showers may linger across the E slopes of the Berkshires through midday Wed, with a few lingering along the S coast early.  Winds may drop off a bit Wed night as better mixing moves offshore, but temps will tumble with mostly clear conditions. Wind chills away from the immediate coast will drop to the single digits, with readings as low as -5 toward daybreak across the E slopes of the Berkshires.  Thursday...  Expect the gusty W-NW winds to continue through midday Thursday, but will start to weaken as the eastern Canadian low slowly exits.  Models continue to signal an H5 short wave passes S of New England. The northern fringe of the precip shield may clip the S coast Thursday morning through midday as the weak low passes close to or just S of the 40N/70W benchmark. Have carried CHC POPs across Nantucket and Martha`s Vineyard. Will see snow showers or a period of light snow for a few hours as the low passes. Little if any snow accumulations are expected.  The arctic air will continue across the region, with high temps only in the upper teens and 20s across the higher inland terrain, ranging to the lower-mid 30s at the shore. As winds drop off during the day, wind chills will not be quite as harsh as on Wed. However, with mainly clear skies Thu night, temps will fall back to the single digits well inland, ranging to 20-25 across the outer Cape and islands.  Friday through Saturday...  Another weak short wave develops across the Great Lakes Fri, while stronger low pressure forms off the SE U.S. coast. The weak low will push E while the coastal low moves NE off the eastern seaboard. Models showing some spread with their development and track of the coastal low, with the GFS closest to the coast but still passing S and E of the 40N/70W benchmark.  Could still see some light snow or snow showers push into SE Mass/E RI, but this is still up in the air for exact track and impacts later Friday into early Saturday.

Thus may have to push back onset times across this area. Also given the lack of cloud cover this evening along the south coast has allowed good radiational cooling 930 pm temps in the mid to upper 20s across Cape Cod and Nantucket. Therefore will adjust hourly temps to reflect this current trend however temps will level off and then rise overnight in the coastal plain with increasing cloud cover and onshore winds developing. Otherwise previous forecast is on track.  Previous discussion...  A strong short wave trough seen on water vapor over IL will be rapidly moving east tonight and to eastern NY late tonight. Low pressure at the surface over Ohio will move into New York state overnight. Warm air advection cloudiness will increase across our region overnight and snow is likely to break out in northwest MA before daybreak. There is a chance that precipitation could reach as far as northern CT and central MA by daybreak.

Any freezing rain should be short-lived but it could be a factor during the morning commute in the Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester areas, as well as the northwest suburbs of Providence. 925 mb temps warm very rapidly on strong southerly low level winds, so it should change to plain rain across most of southern New England during the morning. In fact, high temperatures will reach 50 degrees in RI and southeast MA!  In the higher terrain of northern Worcester County and in the slopes of the Berkshires, snow will be moderate to heavy for a few hours in the morning, with total accumulations ranging from 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts of 5 or 6 inches in the extreme northwest corner of Franklin County, MA.

There is a chance of snow squalls continuing into Wednesday morning as an arctic front progresses across Southern New England. Very little snow accumulation is expected with these passing showers, likely up to an inch at most west of the Worcester Hills.  Winds will pick up in the afternoon as there is an impressive upper level jet overhead. Models are in agreement with 40kts at 925mb mixing down to the surface Wednesday afternoon. The GFS suggests the strongest winds will be over the northern tip of the Cape and extend into Mass Bay. Wind gusts between 40 to 50 mph are not out of the question. Winds will likely peak by 00Z Thursday as the upper level jet sits directly over the region.  Wednesday night temperatures will range in the teens due to the arctic airmass now over the region. With the combination of the arctic airmass and strong surface winds, wind chills are likely to hover near zero degrees overnight. With minimal cloud cover as well, radiational cooling will add to the low apparent temperatures.  Thursday and Friday...  Strong winds will continue into Thursday morning but begin to dissipate throughout the afternoon and evening.  Both the ECMWF and NAM point towards a weak system that brings light snow to the islands and southern coast of New England Thursday afternoon. The system will likely not linger off the coast for very long, resulting in minimal snow accumulations, if any at all.  The arctic airmass remains over the region through Thursday and Friday resulting in much below normal afternoon temperatures. With the winds diminishing by Thursday evening, wind chills should not be an issue, however overnight temperatures will continue to range in the teens across much of the region.  Friday night and Saturday...  A coastal low is expected to clip the region Friday/Saturday resulting in periods of heavy snow along the 95 corridor. Unfortunately, the models are not in agreement with timing or position for when it does make its way up to Southern New England.

It will bring a mixed bag of weather with snow northwest, a mix to rain central, and rain southeast late tonight and Tuesday. A shot of arctic air follows Wednesday and Thursday with a period of strong winds and bitterly cold wind chills. Another low pressure system may bring more snow to the region sometime in the Thursday night to Friday night timeframe, if it tracks close enough to the coast. Somewhat milder weather will arrive by the end of the upcoming weekend.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/... 445 PM update...  A strong short wave trough seen on water vapor over IL will be rapidly moving east tonight and to eastern NY late tonight. Low pressure at the surface over Ohio will move into New York state overnight. Warm air advection cloudiness will increase across our region overnight and snow is likely to break out in northwest MA before daybreak. There is a chance that precipitation could reach as far as northern CT and central MA by daybreak. Although 850 mb temperatures are cold enough for snow, the 925 mb temperatures warm enough such that a few hours of freezing rain are possible in northern CT, northwest RI, and into southern Worcester and Middlesex Counties in MA within a few hours of daybreak. This could be a problem for the morning commute.  We have expanded the Winter Weather Advisory southward and eastward a bit, to include Hartford, Tolland, Windham (in CT), northwest Providence County (in RI), and central and northwest Middlesex Counties (in MA). In these areas, a thin coating...less than one tenth of an inch...of ice is possible before daybreak. The Advisory remains in effect for the remainder of western and central MA.  Lows tonight will be in the 20s except low to mid 30s Cape Cod and the islands. Light winds becoming southeast. Temperatures may begin to rise late in southern areas as southeast winds become established.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/... Tuesday...  Any freezing rain should be short-lived but it could be a factor during the morning commute in the Hartford, Springfield, and Worcester areas, as well as the northwest suburbs of Providence. 925 mb temps warm very rapidly on strong southerly low level winds, so it should change to plain rain across most of southern New England during the morning. In fact, high temperatures will reach 50 degrees in RI and southeast MA!  In the higher terrain of northern Worcester County and in the slopes of the Berkshires, snow will be moderate to heavy for a few hours in the morning, with total accumulations ranging from 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts of 5 or 6 inches in the extreme northwest corner of Franklin County, MA. Even there, some sleet and freezing rain may mix in during the afternoon.  Southeast winds will become gusty...with up to 25-35 mph gusts possible along the coast. We have discounted the NAM, which has what appears to be way too strong of a LLJ of 80 kt at 850 mb and 50-60 kt gusts at the surface. All other models are more like 40-50 kt at 850 mb.  Tuesday night...  Winds shift to the west behind the departing storm system. However, as a vigorous upper level low approaches, scattered snow showers or squalls are possible, which could add some light accumulations, especially in western sections toward Wednesday morning.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... Wednesday...  There is a chance of snow squalls continuing into Wednesday morning as an arctic front progresses across Southern New England. Very little snow accumulation is expected with these passing showers, likely up to an inch at most west of the Worcester Hills.  Winds will pick up in the afternoon as there is an impressive upper level jet overhead. Models are in agreement with 40kts at 925mb mixing down to the surface Wednesday afternoon. The GFS suggests the strongest winds will be over the northern tip of the Cape and extend into Mass Bay. Wind gusts between 40 to 50 mph are not out of the question. Winds will likely peak by 00Z Thursday as the upper level jet sits directly over the region.  Wednesday night temperatures will range in the teens due to the arctic airmass now over the region. With the combination of the arctic airmass and strong surface winds, wind chills are likely to hover near zero degrees overnight. With minimal cloud cover as well, radiational cooling will add to the low apparent temperatures.  Thursday and Friday...  Strong winds will continue into Thursday morning but begin to dissipate throughout the afternoon and evening.  Both the ECMWF and NAM point towards a weak system that brings light snow to the islands and southern coast of New England Thursday afternoon. The system will likely not linger off the coast for very long, resulting in minimal snow accumulations, if any at all.  The arctic airmass remains over the region through Thursday and Friday resulting in much below normal afternoon temperatures. With the winds diminishing by Thursday evening, wind chills should not be an issue, however overnight temperatures will continue to range in the teens across much of the region.  Friday night and Saturday...  A coastal low is expected to clip the region Friday/Saturday resulting in periods of heavy snow along the 95 corridor. Unfortunately, the models are not in agreement with timing or position for when it does make its way up to Southern New England.  Going with guidance from the ECMWF and NAM, precipitation will push north across the region starting at 18z. As the low moves further northeast, east of the 95 corridor will likely see the most accumulation. The coastal low is expected to push offshore by Saturday afternoon.  Sunday...  A ridge builds in Sunday morning behind the coastal low. Winds will turn to the southwest, advecting warmer temperatures into the region by midday.

Thicker clouds were along the south coast and islands, but they should be moving east, with improvement to partial sunshine this afternoon. In western MA, diurnal cloudiness was forming and the HRRR shows that this should spread eastward this afternoon. However, downslope flow should limit the progress east of I-495.

    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM TUESDAY/... *** Mixed Wintry Precip Event Late Tonight into Tomorrow ***  Setup... Dual, unphased shortwaves will generate double barreled low pres situation late Mon night into Tue. The leading wave is currently sliding from Saskatchewan into the N Plains, while the secondary wave slides out of Manitoba into N Ontario. The fact that these remain unphased, allows the initial parent low pres, developing the great lakes to transfer energy to a secondary warm frontal low pres which will slide across central New England or along Gulf of Maine. In either case, developing 40+ kt H92 LLJ will push fully into S New England Tue morning, allowing a nose of warm air between 975-900hPa. This allows the +2C isotherm to reach near the NH/MA border, using an average of available guidance, with slightly cooler temps along the MA/VT border. Given this, precip onset within overrunning ahead of the warm front should start as mainly SN, but then gradually give way to liquid precipitation from SE to NW, with a low risk for mainly SN especially extreme NW MA and into the Berkshires. Thermal profiles are tricky, with more on that below. Latest trends are also slower as the unphased wave takes on a negative tilt and low dwpt depressions take time to overcome tonight, suggesting overall lower QPF than previous runs.  Thermal profiles... While soundings mainly H85 and above remain below 0C, the nose of warm air associated with the LLJ falls mainly in the lower 100hPa. Mean temps in this layer rise above 0C to about route +2C between 12Z and 15Z Tue. Given the dwpt depressions, wet- bulbing would suggest light SN at precip onset, Sfc temps are likely to warm slower, thanks to a lingering snowpack. Areas closest to coastlines could start as a frozen mix.. Not a classic damming signature, but low lvl mass fields do show some weak inverted ridging and mesoscale guidance does have light drainage flow particularly in the CT valley and Worcester Hills. In any case, this is a typical scenario where guidance warms the sfc/2m temps too quickly. The transition to all liquid should generally occur no later than mid day, except in the higher terrain of NW MA, which could remain cool enough for SN/frozen precip.  QPF/Snowfall/Ice... As mentioned above, thanks to a dry column initially overnight, timing of precip onset have slowed and the resulting overall QPF is lower, totaling around 0.30-0.50 Given this, there may be less SN at onset with some areas starting as RA/FZRA. The warm influence also favors lower ratio snows, therefore, have lowered expected snowfall through. The FZRA/SN thinking with this update is backed up by latest WPC Day 2 data. Ice accums would be light as the warm air should translate to the sfc mainly a tenth or so at best, as sfc temps are not expected to be marginal, and not in the 20s, in which ice accumulation is more efficient. Snowfall totals are now lighter, with the best chance for advisory lvl snowfall in the high terrain of NW MA, where the low lvl warm air will be slowest to arrive, if it even ever shifts above 0C. 3-6 inches is the latest forecast for NW MA but with another set of guidance still to come, these are still likely to change a bit.  Timing/impact... Precip, likely mainly in the form of light snow, gradually transitioning to a mix of FZRA and RA begins mainly after 1AM from W to E during the early morning hours Tue, with widespread precipitation likely between 7AM and 1PM, and continuing to change form wintry precip to then gradually ending from S-N mainly after 3PM through 7PM. The Tue AM commute has the highest risk for impact, as SN or even a wintry mix could impact portions of the commute as the warm air build in aloft. Untreated sfc could become slippery thanks to a light SN accums and/or light icing. By the afternoon commute, precip still occurring, but mainly rain outside of the higher terrain of MA particularly.  With all these factors, will hoist Winter Weather Advisories for portions of western and central Massachusetts, where confidence is highest in snowfall totals in the realm of advisory levels, and the best chance for cold air damming supporting some ice accumulations. These may need to be expanded based on new data today.",

Tuesday night through Thursday..  An arctic cold front will move across the region Tue night/Wed accompanied with impressive shortwave energy.  A few brief passing snow showers are likely to impact the region with the arctic front. The bigger question is do we see a few localized intense snow squalls. The shortwave energy is pretty dynamic with some steep 1000 to 700 mb lapse rates.  However, moisture is the wild card and it is usually a limiting factor for this activity making it over the Berks.  We do think there is at least a low risk for a couple.  The other issue will be a period of strong winds.  Bufkit indicates very deep mixing with steep lapse rates and an impressive 850 mb westerly jet. This will bring the potential for westerly wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph Wed into Wed night and wind headlines may eventually be requited.  Lastly...very cold air will be ushered into the region with highs Wed and Thu mainly in the 20s to around 30.

A low pressure over the Great Lakes starts to exert more influence on our weather late Monday Night. Another case of increasing clouds after midnight, with a risk for some precipitation late. Given low temperatures below freezing across pretty much all of southern New England, light snow would be expected over land, with the possibility of some rain over the ocean waters.

Highlights...  * Accumulating snow Tue across interior N MA with any snow quickly   changing to rain in the coastal plain * Arctic air and bitter cold wind chills follow Wed/Thu * More snow possible sometime Thu night to Fri night  Tuesday...  Accumulating snow is the main forecast issue, but latest guidance suggests focus for appreciable snow accum will be confined to interior northern MA west of I495 and especially the Berkshires. Amplifying northern stream trough across the Great Lakes will eventually become negatively tilted over the northeast. Primary low moves into the eastern Lakes while a secondary low is forecast to develop across SNE, but not in time to stop southerly low jet from advecting milder air north across SNE. Models all indicate rapid warming below 850 mb. Any snow early Tue will quickly change to rain across northern CT, RI and E MA as low level warming advances north. However, there could be an issue with a brief period of freezing rain south of the Mass Pike in the interior during the transition from snow to rain.  Further into the interior, especially north of the Pike and west of I495, the snow will last through the morning but even here we expect an eventual changeover to rain in the afternoon. The exception may be across the east slopes of the Berkshires which may remain mostly snow. Preliminary snowfall forecast is for 2-5 inches across northern Worcester county to the Berkshires and possibly into the higher terrain in western Hartford county, but a few locations could reach 6 or 7 inches in the Berkshires, where decent omega in the snow growth region persists the longest. Any accum across RI and eastern MA will likely be limited to less than an inch.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/... Highlights...  * Accumulating snow may impact Tue AM rush hour...mainly northwest   of the BOS-PVD corridor and especially interior northern MA  * Arctic air follows Wed/Thu along with a period of bitterly   cold wind chills  * Some more snow or mixed precipitation possible late Thu night/Fri  Details...  Monday night and Tuesday...  The main concern late Monday night into Tuesday revolves around snow potential and possible impact to the morning rush hour...mainly north and west of the Boston to Providence corridor.  Northern stream shortwave energy will be diving south towards the Great Lakes along with an initial surface low tracking to our northwest.  The result will be a decent southerly LLJ developing which will increase the forcing for ascent.  The antecedent airmass is cold, but given southeast winds blowing off the ocean in early December is not usually a recipe for much snow along the coastal plain.  While a brief period of snow can not be ruled out, unless guidance changes significantly would be tough to get more than an inch.  The forecast is more complex to the northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor and particularly across interior northern MA. The cold antecedent airmass should result in at least a period of snow, but whether accums are minor or several inches hinges on a few things.  Some of the 00z guidance has trended a bit quicker with secondary coastal development, which would slow down or limit the mid level warm surge.  A very small change in thermal profiles can make a difference from some areas receiving an inch vs 5 inches of snow.

Local OBs and MSAS suggest the low pres near 990hPa and just S of Nova Scotia as such the strongest low-mid lvl f-gen continues to pull to the E with it, snowfall rates having dropped significantly, with what little is left having vsbys +6sm. Meanwhile, dry air continues to filter in from the S aloft, mainly above H6, with enough lower lvl moisture to yield some light SHSN continuing over the next few hours, ending especially once BL mixing is able to dry out the near sfc moisture. Also, given the dry-over-moist sounding profile, cannot rule out some occasional freezing drizzle, continuing the risk for slippery conditions where roads are untreated.  Otherwise today, clearing and drying expected in advance of the primary upper lvl shortwave which will move through overnight. CAA aloft will allow H85 temps to drop to near -10C by 00Z this evening, which combined with a new snowpack across much of interior S New England will keep high temps mainly in the low- mid 30s, near 40 where little to no snowfall fell. Breezy, as the CAA will allow tapping of the W LLJ which is near 30 kt. Gusts to around 25mph can be expected.

Highlights...  * Accumulating snow may impact Tue AM rush hour...mainly northwest   of the BOS-PVD corridor and especially interior northern MA  * Arctic air follows Wed/Thu along with a period of bitterly   cold wind chills  * Some more snow or mixed precipitation possible late Thu night/Fri  Details...  Monday night and Tuesday...  The main concern late Monday night into Tuesday revolves around snow potential and possible impact to the morning rush hour...mainly north and west of the Boston to Providence corridor.  Northern stream shortwave energy will be diving south towards the Great Lakes along with an initial surface low tracking to our northwest.  The result will be a decent southerly LLJ developing which will increase the forcing for ascent.  The antecedent airmass is cold, but given southeast winds blowing off the ocean in early December is not usually a recipe for much snow along the coastal plain.  While a brief period of snow can not be ruled out, unless guidance changes significantly would be tough to get more than an inch.  The forecast is more complex to the northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor and particularly across interior northern MA. The cold antecedent airmass should result in at least a period of snow, but whether accums are minor or several inches hinges on a few things.  Some of the 00z guidance has trended a bit quicker with secondary coastal development, which would slow down or limit the mid level warm surge.  A very small change in thermal profiles can make a difference from some areas receiving an inch vs 5 inches of snow. While this remains uncertain, the potential for several inches of snow is highest across interior northern MA.  Regardless, the Tuesday morning rush hour will likely be impacted to some degree. Will also have to watch for a band of ice in the transition zone as low level cold air will be tough to scour out. The bulk of the precipitation should be over by late afternoon.

This continues to draw low-mid lvl f-gen toward the low center and across E MA/RI. Have watched the banding signature become more defuse over the last few hours as a result and expect that this trend will continue as the f-gen shifts E and dry air begins to filter in above H6 per wv imagery. Will see a slow dissipation of snowfall rates through early AM, so will maintain current warnings/advisories and re- evaluate at that time. Focused an area of higher snow/qpf mainly N of Plymouth through the S shore of MA where good coastal front signature resides, right along the current SN/RA line per latest 0.5 CC image.  Otherwise, am a bit concerned for freezing drizzle as snowfall rates recede. As mentioned above, good dry air infusion already occurring aloft, and a resulting subsidence inversion is apparent on soundings. This is likely to trap some of the lower lvl moisture through much of the overnight hours until BL mixing can help to scour our the moisture near sfc. Will be adding FZDZ to the forecast overnight, and this may keep conditions a bit slippery even after snows drop off. This may warrant the maintenance of at least some winter wx advisories, but again will reassess this risk later.  Previous Discussion...  Surface low will pass near the 40N/70W benchmark by around 00Z-01Z, then will shift NE across the eastern Gulf of Maine and S of Nova Scotia overnight. Besides bringing the snowfall to an end, winds will shift northwest and become gusty late. Min temperatures should be slightly be normal, with wind chill values in the teens and 20s.

Highly amplified mid level pattern continues across North America early next week, with deep troughing along the eastern seaboard and ridge nosing into western Alaska and the Northwest Territories early next week. 12Z models showing some weakening of the long wave trough, but keeps lower H5 heights across the northeast U.S. through a good portion of next week.  With the western ridge holding in place through a good portion of next week, the base of the trough will hang across the northeast, will likely see a couple of waves move along in this general flow.

A lot of questions beyond Thursday as the western ridge shows signs of breaking down and moving slowly east, but it appears that long wave troughing will continue through the remainder of the long term period at this point.  Details...  Monday...  Expect the H5 short wave to push offshore early Monday, with weak high pressure quickly moving across. Expect mainly cloudy skies early, then becoming partly cloudy by late morning. Mid level flow briefly flattens around the base of the trough. However, the next H5 short wave quickly moves out of the western Ohio valley late Mon, so clouds will move back in again during the afternoon.

Expect the best chance for precip around or after midnight Mon night through around mid morning Tue, then will push eastward.  Thermal profiles signaling mainly light snow except along the immediate coast Mon night then, with marginal temps rising with light S-SE winds along the shore, snow will mix with or change to rain along a good portion of the coastal plain by mid-late Tue morning. This, along with QPF values on order of 0.1 to 0.3 inches for this event, should see only light snowfall amounts.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/... *** Moderate snow event for southern New England will occur today *** *** Snowfall accums nearing 3-7 inches are anticipated ***  1030 AM update...  As with the previous update, main change was to slow the arrival of snowfall a little bit more. Lots of dry air near the ground which needs to be overcome before the steady snowfall can get going. Already seeing spotty reports of snowfall as far north as Windsor Locks CT, Worcester MA, Bedford MA and Beverly MA. Precipitation is expected to fill in over the next couple of hours, then spread farther north and west. The steadiest snow will occur this afternoon and early evening.  Minor tweaks to temperatures and dew points to reflect observed trends.  Previous Discussion Below...  Near term Analysis...  Latest water vapor imagery continues to show digging northern shortwave into the Great Lakes/Chicago region. Down south, southern stream wave continues to push moisture plume up the eastern seaboard as the longwave trough begins to sharpen. Continue to watch and see if the northern stream wave will be able to capture the southern to help pull the bulk of the moisture back into the region this morning. Right now the bulk of the precip continues to remain across the Mid-Atlantic and offshore, with Nantucket receiving on and off showers.  Overview...  00z guidance members continue to remain in agreement for today`s event. The RGEM however was on the beefier side with its QPF thus went ahead and discounted it. Overall, sharpening upper level trough due to potent northern stream wave will continue to dig through the pattern this morning. Southern stream wave which brought record breaking snow to the Deep South will begin to advect towards the Northeast after developing a surface low off the Carolina coast. These two pieces of the energy will try to phase the pattern later today pushing the low up towards the 40N/70W benchmark. This will help push the deep layer moisture over the region and with approaching upper level jet and QG forcing expect precip to fall for most of the day today and into tonight. Surface low will continue to deepen tonight as it moves towards the Maritimes.  Details...  QPF: Models remain in agreement with the ongoing forecast. Axis of heavier precip remains across the I-95 corridor and points east near 0.7 inches with 1 inch near Nantucket. QPF lesses as you move westward. Concern about the uptick in the RGEM as moisture associated with this system is from the Gulf leading to 2 STD above normal for PWATS. Something to keep in mind today. Will have to also watch and see how much moisture back towards the region today as upper level wave digs into the Ohio Valley. The HRRR and RAP may be on that trend with less QPF for the first half of the day, and then quickly increasing it later today and into tonight. This may be due to the northern upper level jet streak approaching the region. Still time to adjust if needed. Overall blended the EC with Hi-res guidance to get ongoing QPF forecast.  P-TYPE: Mainly a rain and snow event for most of southern New England. Biggest question is where the rain/snow line will set-up. Current temps across the region are still in the mid to low 30s, warmer as you get near the coast. However, dewpoints are well into the 20s and with wet-bulb processes taking place this morning, temps will fall below freezing, resulting in snow. Nantucket may be more mix at the onset, but should remain mainly rain as they will be within the warm layer for much of the event. Hi-res guidance as well as the NCAR and HREF show a coastal front setting up across immediate coastal Plymouth and the Canal. Winds remaining more to the Northeast on the east side of the front will result in temps warming into the mid 30s. Thus more rain than snow. While on the west side of the front, due northerly winds will keep temps below freezing. Guidance has been a bit wobbling on the frontal placement so it will have to be watched closely as amounts could be enhanced just west of the front. Lastly, weak warm nose in the low levels may result in some p-type issues for the immediate south coast. Cannot rule out some sleet late this afternoon into the evening hours. The warm nose will quickly depart tonight as cold air ushers in from the west.  One thing that was noticed this morning was that once winds switch to the northwest late this evening/tonight, some of the hi-res guidance is increasing 2m temps into the upper 30s to low 40s. Perhaps they are indicating that mixing will take place resulting in a brief warm-up. If this does occur, believe models temps may be a bit to warm as soundings keep a good portion of the profile at or below freezing.  Snowfall & Intensity: Forecast snowfall amounts are similar to the previous shift with just a few slight adjustments. Generally anticipating a 4-7 inch event with higher amounts along the I-495 belt down towards the Rhode Island hills. This region has enough QPF, cooler temps, and the high terrain to help result in a few 8 inch amounts. While there weren`t a lot of changes to the snowfall amounts, one region that will have to be watch is the MA coastal plain. If the coastal front sets-up east then currently forecast then this area may see higher amounts and thus an upgrade to the warning may be needed. Snowfall intensity will be generally light with some modest bursts today. There is some descent lift in the snow growth region, but overall it is fairly marginal through the entire event. F-gen banding may develop as indicated by some guidance members which could help produce some banding. Perhaps one over southeast MA and the other across the interior/western MA. Still have to wait for these potential bands to set-up as they could still change. Overall a light snowfall intensity with some on-off bands which could lower vsbys and help increase snowfall rate to near 1 inch.  Generally speaking this is a moderate snow event for the region with ranges between 3-7 inches. Higher amounts if bands end-up setting up across the region. But overall anticipate snow to be light with some brief moderate bursts through the day. Just a reminder, this is the first snowfall of the season so motorist should use caution if traveling. Snowfall will begin to taper off from west to east during the overnight hours with perhaps lingering snow showers across the east coast towards daybreak.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /SUNDAY/... Sunday...  Strong shortwave energy will swing across the region Sunday.  This will probably result in a few lingering snow showers Sunday morning, especially across eastern MA where moisture is deeper.  Otherwise, a mainly dry but blustery day is on tap.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...

Details...  Sunday night and Monday...  Upper trough over the northeast will result in continued chilly weather.  Low temps Sun night will mainly be in the upper teens to the middle 20s.  High temps on Mon will recover well into the 30s to near 40.  While the majority of this time will feature dry weather, a shortwave may bring a brief passing snow shower or two late Sun night/early Mon with the best chance across southern sections.  Monday night and Tuesday...  Low pressure will be tracking eastward from the Great Lakes late Mon night and Tue, likely passing to our north.  This should generate a decent low level jet over an antecedent cold airmass.  This will probably generate a period of snow/ice northwest of I-95 and especially the distant interior late Mon night/Tue am.  While this does not look to be a big storm there is the potential for an impact to the Tuesday morning rush hour.  Along and southeast of the Boston to Providence corridor, enough southeast boundary layer wind will probably result in precipitation mainly in the form of rain.  Tuesday night into Thursday...  Impressive northern stream shortwave/arctic cold front may generate a few snow showers Tuesday night and Wednesday.  Given the potential strength of the shortwave, can not rule out at least a low risk for a period of some inverted trough snow with developing ocean storm. Latest guidance indicates that it may develop too late for a classic Noreaster in our region, but still bears some watching in the Tue night early Wed time frame.  Otherwise, main story will be shot of arctic air Wed into Thu with potential for wind chills to drop below zero.  It also may become quite windy for a time.  Thursday night and Friday...  Temperatures will moderate by Friday ahead of another shortwave. Will have to keep an eye on the potential for a period of wintry precipitation, but confidence is quite low at this time.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...  1030 PM Update...  Overall trend in the forecast remains on track for this evening. Potent northern stream shortwave is beginning to dig into the northern Great Lakes as seen in latest water vapor imagery. Across the southeast and up towards the Mid-Atlantic, moisture plume riding along a 700 mb front will continue to stream north and eastward overnight. Dewpoints at the surface are already slowly falling an thus overnight temps will begin to dip as well esp in the interior. However large cloud shield will keep temps from truly radiating out. As the northern stream digs, moisture southeast of the region will begin to back into southern New England being the focus for precip early tomorrow morning. Aside from some showers along the Nantucket expect a dry forecast for much of the night. Have noticed some trends in speeding up precip for the immediate south coast, so will continue to monitor. Otherwise warnings and advisories remain the same.  Previous Discussion...  Mid level trough amplification occurs overnight as northern and southern stream energy diving into the OH and MS/TN valleys back the mid level flow along the eastern seaboard. This captures deep layer moisture offshore and pivots onto the south coast as the night progresses. All Hi Res guidance brings qpf onto Nantucket 7 pm to 10 pm then 1 am to 7 am across Marthas Vineyard and immediate south coast of RI/MA including Cape Cod. For Nantucket, model soundings suggest precip begins as rain but then changes over to snow briefly toward midnight before changing back to rain. As for BID/MVY, Cape Cod and immediate south coast of RI/MA precip should begin as light rain and then changeover to snow toward morning as precip intensity increases and wet bulb temps are reached thru the column.

ARW and NMM are less but given qpf falls beyond 24 hrs mesoscale guid skill typically diminishes after 24 hrs and especially after 36 hrs. Also given this is a southern stream system with origins in the Gulf of Mexico prefer the trends from the Global guidance.  Ptype...  Initially airmass over southern New England is cold enough to support all snow however as the low approaches light winds become NNE and this will change snow to rain across Cape Cod and the Islands Saturday morning. Farther inland have to watch a warm nose at 950 mb on model soundings that will likely push the rain-snow into southeast MA and coastal RI. Some uncertainty how far inland this boundary traverses but could enter the I-95 corridor of RI and southeast MA, thus getting close to Providence and Boston especially the southern suburbs of Boston. Not expecting heavy snow intensity to overcome this so followed model thermal fields and soundings closely to derive ptype.  Thinking the city of Boston to the north shore and much of Cape Ann remain mostly snow given NNE traj and pres falls perhaps developing a weak coastal front to keep rain-snow line just south and east to the city. Will have to watch this closely with each model run.  Snow Accumulations...  Given 12z models trended a bit heavier with qpf new snow totals are an inch or two higher from previous forecast. This yields a stripe of 4-7 inches of snow across eastern CT, northwest RI into central and northeast MA including the city of Boston. Elsewhere 3-6\" with an inch or two across Cape Cod and the islands given a shorter duration of snow before a changeover to rain. Think model qpf is reasonable and not expecting this event to overperform given only modest lift (10 ubar/s) in the snow growth region yielding snow to liquid ratios (SLR) of 10-1 to 12-1. In addition tomorrow`s snow event will feature multiple mesoscale snow bands, first across southeast MA/RI in the morning and then pivoting into the interior during the afternoon. The bands don`t appear to be collocated with much instability or pivot over the same area (very transitory). So there could be a few hours where snowfall rates may approach an inch per hour for a 1-3 hr period, but overall looking at a period of mainly light to moderate snow tomorrow. So in a nutshell not expecting this event to overperform model qpf by much if at all.  Regarding ground temps, have had several nights now with subfreezing temps and today highs stayed mainly in the 30s. Temps tonight dip into the 20s for much of the region. So the ground will be cold enough for snow to accumulate tomorrow and especially now that we are in Dec sun angle is very low. If this was March there would be some concern on less accumulation on paved surfaces.  Headlines...  Given new forecast snow totals are now in the 4-7\" range have decided to upgrade the Winter Weather Advisory to a Winter Storm Warning where forecast confidence is highest.

Chilly start to the day as upper level shortwave begins to dive into the northern Great Lakes. This will result in a deepening trough in the Southeast with weak ridging over southern New England.

However towards the evening, precip chances will begin to increase as approaching system from the Carolinas will start to push some moisture towards the Cape and the Islands.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...  Tonight into Saturday night...  *** Confidence is increasing in widespread 3-6 inches of snow for much of southern New England on Saturday ***  Overview:  Anomalous ridging over the West Coast with a broad upper level trough over the eastern two-thirds of the country. Several vort maxes moving through the trough will be the focus for our weather system tonight into Saturday night. The first is the southern stream wave which has produced snow down in south Texas. This wave will move over the Southeast and help develop a low off the coast of the Carolinas. The other piece of energy is still up in northern Canada and will quickly dive southward into the northern Great Lakes. By Saturday, these two systems will phase and deepen the offshore low pass the 40N/70W benchmark before moving towards the Maritimes by Sunday morning.  Details:  First significant snowfall for the region will occur late tonight and into early Sunday morning. Latest guidance members appear to come more inline than 24 hours ago on thermals and precipitation amounts leading to an increasing confidence on snow potential. Still some timing issues with the Hi-res guidance a bit on the slow side and the EC on the faster side of the envelope. NAM is a bit more robust on the QPF compared to the GFS/EC. Aside from some of these differences continued to trend the forecast towards a blend with more emphasis on the EC and GEFS/EPS.  One thing to continue to watch is the axis of heavier QPF. Models are similar to previous run and keeps about an inch of QPF over Nantucket with 0.4 inches across Western MA and over 0.5 inches near the I-95 corridor. Feel that this is a good blend with all the guidance. However, with the northern stream wave getting closer to the region, feel that it will be sampled a bit better and thus cannot rule out a slight eastward or westward jog. Even if there is some wiggle, overall feel that this is a solid advisory event.  Snowfall will begin to overspread the region late tonight and quickly take hold of the region Saturday morning. Expect p-type to stay all snow at the onset as temperatures will start out well below freezing. As the coastal low approaches the Benchmark during the day, thermals will become a bit more complicated as a warm layer begins to sneak into 925mb and surface temps warm along the coastline thanks to a developing coastal front. As the low pulls away cold air will wrap behind the system turning any liquid back to frozen by Saturday night.  Forecast snowfall amounts is a general 3-6 inches with the potential for higher amounts across the Central Hills of Massachusetts and Rhode Islands.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  400 AM Update...  Shortwave in the mid-levels continues to transverse eastward towards the Maritimes during the early morning hours. CAA behind the wave will continue to usher into the region dropping 850 mb temps to 10C. At the surface, LES streamers continue to move across NY and towards western MA. This could result in some flurries for locations north of Route 2.  Otherwise moisutre across the Southeast will continue to move along the eastern seaboard and stream toward the region. Appears that the moisture is reaching the far south coast in mid to upper level clouds. Keeping temperatures from truly falling. Across the interior, temps have fallen into the low to mid 20s resulting in another chilly start for the day.  Today...  Chilly start to the day as upper level shortwave begins to dive into the northern Great Lakes. This will result in a deepening trough in the Southeast with weak ridging over southern New England. Zonal flow in the mid-levels will turn more meridional which will help pull in moisture from the south. This will yield to an increase in cloud cover through the day. High temps will be similar to yesterday or just a few degrees cooler as cloud cover will limit heating during the afternoon.  Overall expect mainly dry weather for today. However towards the evening, precip chances will begin to increase as approaching system from the Carolinas will start to push some moisture towards the Cape and the Islands.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...  Tonight into Saturday night...  *** Confidence is increasing in widespread 3-6 inches of snow for much of southern New England on Saturday ***  Overview:  Anomalous ridging over the West Coast with a broad upper level trough over the eastern two-thirds of the country. Several vort maxes moving through the trough will be the focus for our weather system tonight into Saturday night. The first is the southern stream wave which has produced snow down in south Texas. This wave will move over the Southeast and help develop a low off the coast of the Carolinas. The other piece of energy is still up in northern Canada and will quickly dive southward into the northern Great Lakes. By Saturday, these two systems will phase and deepen the offshore low pass the 40N/70W benchmark before moving towards the Maritimes by Sunday morning.  Details:  First significant snowfall for the region will occur late tonight and into early Sunday morning. Latest guidance members appear to come more inline than 24 hours ago on thermals and precipitation amounts leading to an increasing confidence on snow potential. Still some timing issues with the Hi-res guidance a bit on the slow side and the EC on the faster side of the envelope. NAM is a bit more robust on the QPF compared to the GFS/EC. Aside from some of these differences continued to trend the forecast towards a blend with more emphasis on the EC and GEFS/EPS.  One thing to continue to watch is the axis of heavier QPF. Models are similar to previous run and keeps about an inch of QPF over Nantucket with 0.4 inches across Western MA and over 0.5 inches near the I-95 corridor. Feel that this is a good blend with all the guidance. However, with the northern stream wave getting closer to the region, feel that it will be sampled a bit better and thus cannot rule out a slight eastward or westward jog. Even if there is some wiggle, overall feel that this is a solid advisory event.  Snowfall will begin to overspread the region late tonight and quickly take hold of the region Saturday morning. Expect p-type to stay all snow at the onset as temperatures will start out well below freezing. As the coastal low approaches the Benchmark during the day, thermals will become a bit more complicated as a warm layer begins to sneak into 925mb and surface temps warm along the coastline thanks to a developing coastal front. As the low pulls away cold air will wrap behind the system turning any liquid back to frozen by Saturday night.  Forecast snowfall amounts is a general 3-6 inches with the potential for higher amounts across the Central Hills of Massachusetts and Rhode Islands. This region may have just enough QPF and higher snow ratios to push them above the 6 inch amounts.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...  1000 PM Update...  Southwest flow aloft continues for the evening as mid-level disturbances pushes through the flow this evening. This wave has increased low level lapse rates and has pushed a more WSW to ENE flow with the LES. Radar Mosaic imagery for the Northeast does show these LES showers across upstate NY with the Lake Erie moisture plume reaching the Berkshires. Will continue the mention of some snow showers but any accumulations will be low.   Precip to the south moving across PA and into NYC appears to be focused along a boundary as winds are generally out of the west in PA, with southwest winds across NJ. SPC meso analysis shows some forcing at the 1000-950 mb level in that region and with potent upper level jet streak and 925 LLJ over the region believe these showers will continue but remain south of the area. Cannot rule out a sprinkle or flurry for the Island however. Just something to watch.  Previous discussion... After the wave passage this evening, only a minor response with mid-upper lvl ridge building which will begin to carry upper lvl moisture associated with a stalled boundary to the S, yielding a gradual increase in upper lvl clouds, even as the lake effect moisture is essentially cutoff. Therefore, although winds do go light, not a perfect radiational cooling scenario, but give a dip in dwpts into the teens to around 20F, overnight mins should still drop into the low-mid 20s with some decoupling. Otherwise, dry forecast overnight.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/... Tomorrow... Weak mid lvl ridging and the development of confluent flow aloft will, thanks to lingering subsidence inversion, slow the moisture loading. This loading process begins from top-down, with building upper then mid lvl clouds throughout the day. PWATs end the day (as in 00Z) near 0.7 inches along extreme SE MA. However there remains a layer from the sfc to H8 with dwpt depressions at or exceeding 10F. Given this, will continue with a mainly dry forecast through much of the daylight hours, with only slight chance POPs at ACK by late afternoon and evening. However, timing continues to slow with POPs on meso-scale guidance, something to consider with future updates.  Temps are expected to be cooler than today as previous forecaster noted. This is thanks to a combination of a colder start in the morning, combined with more widespread cloud cover throughout the day. This is in spite of ever so slight warm advection aloft within the modest mid lvl ridge.  Tomorrow night... Continually increasing moisture through the sounding. It will take some time for the low lvl dwpt depressions to fully be overcome, however this is mostly likely across ACK and Cape Cod, closer to the src of lift along the stalled frontal boundary to the S, and within the deepest moisture as PWATs reach nearly +1-sigma by 12Z Sat. Therefore, will yield very gradual increase in POPs from SE to NW through the overnight hours such that most remain dry, but a low risk for showery precip possible across extreme SE MA toward Sat morning. Min temps much warmer than Thu night, as cloud cover and increased moisture will limit diurnal curve, yielding mainly upper 20s NW to low-mid 30s SE.  P-type with the precipitation is somewhat tricky, although soundings suggest that the sfc to H92 wetbulb is near or below 0C, am not confident dynamics are strong enough to support much additional cooling. SSTs surround the Cape/Islands remain close to 10C, so this will likely help to moderate temps somewhat. Given these factors, will favor a mainly SHRA scenario, although if precip rates increase toward morning as the low pres wave to the S, develops this could yield a transition to light and generally non-accumulating snow/rain mix.",

Highlights...  * Light to moderate snow accum Sat/Sat night w/highest risk near the   I-95 corridor * Coastal storm may bring more snow and/or rain Tue into early Wed * Blustery and unseasonably cold weather follows late Wed into Thu  Overview...  Anomalous ridging over the western CONUS and north Atlantic will result in persistent deep trough across eastern Canada to the Gt Lakes and northeast. Northern stream shortwave energy rotating around the western ridge and digging southward will bring risk of multiple snow events to SNE while also delivering a blast of arctic air around Wed/Thu timeframe as piece of the polar vortex breaks off and descends south into New Eng.  Details...  Saturday and Saturday night...  Models continue to trend west with potential moderate impact snow event for Sat/Sat night. This is the result of an amplifying northern stream shortwave which digs south across the Gt Lakes and Ohio valley, producing a more robust coastal low tracking further NW and closer to the benchmark with deep moisture axis overspreading much of SNE. Confidence is increasing in at least a moderate snow event across portions of SNE as the guidance is converging toward 0.50\" QPF extending back along and west of the I-95 corridor with heavier QPF to the SE. The westward trend has also introduced more warming in the boundary layer with ptype issues across Cape/Islands and possibly into far SE MA.  It is still too soon to know if this westward trend will continue as the responsible shortwave at 12z today was still near the Arctic ocean and not captured within the better sampling upper air network. This may not be well sampled until the 12z Fri model suite so additional changes still likely.  Given the ECMWF and GFS were in good agreement on track/intensity of the coastal low and QPF field we used a blend of these guidance sources as a basis for the forecast. This suggests heaviest snowfall may occur near and a bit west of the I-95 corridor with lesser amounts further SE and especially toward Cape Cod due to potential mixing issues or changeover to rain. We will have preliminary max forecast of 4-6 inches from NE CT and central MA to interior SE MA, a bit less toward CT valley. Snow amounts decreasing to 2 inches near the Cape Cod canal and less than an inch for outer Cape/islands where ptype issues more certain. Heaviest snow likely Sat afternoon and evening before tapering off. This scenario actually in decent agreement with EPS ensembles. No watches yet due to areal uncertainty, marginal warning event and we are still 2-3 days out in the model world.  However it is important to emphasize that further changes are possible. A further west trend would bring heavier snow back across western MA and CT with rain/snow line possibly threatening BOS-PVD corridor. While a SE trend brings more snow near the coast with less interior.  Sunday through Friday...  Main emphasis was placed on Sat/Sat night event so we did not focus much on this portion of the forecast. Another digging northern stream shortwave may result in a potential significant coastal storm sometime Tue-Wed timeframe but pattern is complex with multiple shortwaves moving through the flow.

Heaviest snow likely Sat afternoon and evening before tapering off. This scenario actually in decent agreement with EPS ensembles. No watches yet due to areal uncertainty, marginal warning event and we are still 2-3 days out in the model world.  However it is important to emphasize that further changes are possible. A further west trend would bring heavier snow back across western MA and CT with rain/snow line possibly threatening BOS-PVD corridor. While a SE trend brings more snow near the coast with less interior.  Sunday through Friday...  Main emphasis was placed on Sat/Sat night event so we did not focus much on this portion of the forecast. Another digging northern stream shortwave may result in a potential significant coastal storm sometime Tue-Wed timeframe but pattern is complex with multiple shortwaves moving through the flow. Low confidence on timing/location and track of the storm. What we are confident about is a blast of arctic air and windy conditions following this storm later Wed into Thu.",

Upper level shortwave will sharpen and dig into the northern Great Lakes tomorrow. This will push the region into a more southwest flow however temps aloft remain the same as today. But with more clouds moving into the region thanks to increase mid-level moisture, temps will be similar to today or just a few degrees cooler.  Overall expect mainly dry weather for Friday.

Highlights...  * Accumulating snow possible Sat/Sat night w/highest risk E MA/RI * Chilly on Sun with a few brief snow showers/flurries possible * Coastal storm may bring rain and/or snow Mon night into Tue night * Unseasonably cold weather follows Wed into Thu  Details...  Friday night...  Southern stream shortwave may bring some light rain and/or light snow to the far southeast New England coast Friday night.  However, the amplification of this shortwave may be limited so it may be a struggle for precipitation to make it much further northwest than that.  If some light rain and/or light snow does make it onto the southeast New England coast, marginal boundary layer temps and light precipitation intensity will probably result in little if any appreciable snow accumulation.  Saturday and Saturday night...  The potential continues for the first accumulating snowfall across portions of the region with the highest risk across eastern MA/RI. It remains uncertain how far northwest main axis of precipitation will make it along with potential boundary layer issues across southeast New England.  The big wild card is the strength and timing of northern stream energy dropping southeast towards the Great Lakes. If it becomes amplified enough it will pull moisture off the mid Atlantic coast into southern New England.  On the flip side of the coin, if it ends up a little less amplified there will be little if any precipitation that makes it northwest of the Cape Cod Canal.  It appears that the best chance for some snow will be Saturday, especially during the afternoon and night.  As we talked about in the previous paragraph, there remains considerable uncertainty amongst the models on how far northwest the axis of precipitation gets and boundary layer issues are possible across the southeast New England coast.  The 00Z GFS/GGEM fail to get much precipitation northwest of the Cape Cod Canal.  The ECMWF/UKMET are the most aggressive bringing measurable precipitation northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor and into parts of the interior. The EPS/GEFS individual ensemble members continue to show a large spread in possible outcomes.  These include complete misses, to a plowable snow across eastern MA/RI. There are even a few outlier members that focus the accumulating snow across the interior with boundary layer issues working onto the coastal plain with a more amplified/westward track.  In a nutshell, the greatest risk for some accumulating snow will be across portions of eastern MA and RI, but impacts further into the interior can not be ruled out. Boundary layer may be too warm east of the Cape Cod Canal to get much if any accumulating snow.  6Z Guidance Update...  The latest 6z model suite mainly the NAM/GFS and its ensembles have shifted the precipitation axis significantly further northwest.  We certainly do not want to make any changes based on one suite of model runs, but given the westward support from the UKMET/ECMWF there may be an increasing threat for accumulating snow back into the interior.  Again though, no changes until we see how the 12z model suite trends.  Sunday...  A shortwave crosses the region with perhaps a few brief passing snow showers/flurries.  High temps mainly in the 30s to around 40.  Monday through Tuesday night...  While much of the daytime hours on Monday look dry, potent shortwave energy will carve out a deep trough to our west.  This may allow for coastal low pressure to develop and perhaps rapidly intensify. Depending on when/where and how fast this exactly happens will determine just how we are impacted.  All we can say is there is the potential for rain and/or accumulating snow Monday night through Tuesday night along with some wind.  Wednesday...

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...  Ongoing remains on track for this evening. Temperatures have truly radiated out across western MA thanks to clear skies and light winds so have adjusted the forecast accordingly. In fact, there is a 20 degree spread from ORE to ACK.  High level clouds continue to hang tough across the south coast up to the south shore. This is starting to limit radiational cooling as the clouds are a bit think. Still a chilly night out there.  Lastly did increase clouds out west which will slow temps from dropping any more. Satellite imagery shoes thick deck moving in from the Berks.  Previous Discussion...  Post frontal cold air advection continues to overspread southern New England. SPC mesoanalysis has 850 temps currently +3C over Nantucket to -7C entering Berkshire county of western MA. Thus much colder than last night with lows tonight in the 20s, low 30s along the coast. Main change to the forecast was to insert more cloudiness /mid to high clouds/ across CT/RI and much of eastern MA in response to continue SW flow aloft and associated upper level jet streak. Otherwise previous forecast on track. Earlier discussion below.  ================================================================  Cold air advection persisted this afternoon, as temps remained nearly steady or slowly fell.  For tonight surface ridging extends into southern New England. Expecting mostly clear skies with light west winds, with some cirrus brushing us from the south this evening. Exception could be over the higher terrain of the east slopes of the Berkshires, where lake effect moisture could bring some stratocumulus. Elsewhere, low level westerly flow expected to provide a downslope component to limit spread of any stratocumulus.  Expecting good radiational cooling tonight with overnight lows in the 20s, except some low to mid 30s near the shoreline.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/... Thursday...  Weather influenced by high pressure centered to the SW of our area, as well as dry air from SW mid level flow. Just enough moisture in the low levels to produce some diurnal stratocumulus, mostly sunny skies expected. Low level winds out of the west continue to provide a downsloping component. Temperatures will remain seasonable with highs in the upper 30s to mid 40s, though some locales in the higher terrain of the east slopes of the Berkshires only reach the mid 30s.  Thursday night...  Dry and cold weather expected Thu night with weak surface ridging and continued SW mid level flow. Our area is in between low pressure systems, one to the NW over the Great Lakes region, and another well to the S. Mostly clear to partly cloudy skies along with light winds should allow for overnight lows in the upper teens and 20s. Could see somewhat less cold lows in the low to mid 30s along some portions of the shoreline.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... 425 PM update...  Highlights...  * Seasons 1st snowfall possible Fri ngt/Sat but details uncertain * Chilly with a few snow showers possible Sunday * Potential coastal storm may bring rain/snow to the region next   Tue/Wed followed by bitter cold  Friday...  Sunshine to begin the day but mid and high clouds on the increase as approaching mid level trough over the OH valley in the morning advances eastward and backs the mid level flow. This allows offshore moisture to advect northeast into southern New England during the day from south to north. All model guidance suggest precip may come onshore toward nightfall across Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard. Model soundings across this area suggest blyr may be too warm for all snow at the onset, so a mix of rain and snow possible.  Regarding temps, chilly airmass over the region with -8C at 850 mb and -4C at 925 mb 18z Friday. Model sounding suggest mixing heights almost to 850 mb so highs should range from the upper 30s to lower 40s.  These temps are a few degs colder than normal for early Dec. Mid 40s possible along the south coast given southwest winds streaming across the relatively warm ocean waters that are in the mid to upper 40s.  Friday night thru Saturday night...  Still lots of uncertainty regarding how far northwest deep moisture and lift track from offshore frontal wave. Most of the deterministic guidance including 12z NAM/GFS/EC/Ukmet and GEFS ensembles place sharp qpf gradient over RI and southeast MA. The 12z Euro ensembles are a bit farther inland from southeast CT across RI into eastern MA. Keep in mind average model error at this time range (60-84 hrs) is about 125 miles! Thus risk for accumulating snow ranges from eastern CT to the Worcester Hills into northeast MA (northwest edge of envelope of solutions) to offshore (eastern most edge of solutions), including areas in between. To further complicate the forecast blyr and surface temps may be too warm for an all snow event over the Cape and Islands, so rain may lower the snowfall potential here. Therefore lots of uncertainty continues. Hence important to keep this portion of the forecast probabilistic rather than deterministic as all potential outcomes remain in play.  As previous forecaster mention it will come down to trough amplification entering the Great Lakes late Sat/Sat night. Tracing back the jet energy that will carve out this mid level trough was coming onshore to Alaska this morning. Unfortunately 12z upper air soundings are no longer available across the state of Alaska. This may result in a different model trend beginning with tonight`s 00z guidance as this jet energy becomes better sampled by more 00z upper air soundings along with increased aircraft data at 00z vs 12z.  Sunday...  Potent mid level trough moves across the area with strong forcing for ascent. Steep lapse rates develop in response to -34C at 500 mb moving over the area. However limiting factor here is lack of deep layer moisture. This should limit areal coverage of any snow showers to isolated for widely scattered. Chilly, about 5-8 degs colder than normal with highs 35-40. It will becoming windy during the evening with the trough passage.  Monday through Wednesday ...  Monday with begin very cold start with lows in the teens and 20s. Dry weather likely prevails. Highs probably only recovering to 35- 40, possibly into the 40s along the south coast as winds become southwest. Around Tue arctic front drops southward with cyclogenesis developing along or ahead of the front. Large model spread here on location/timing of potential coastal/ocean low.

Exception could be over the higher terrain of the east slopes of the Berkshires, where lake effect moisture could bring some stratocumulus. Elsewhere, low level westerly flow expected to provide a downslope component to limit spread of any stratocumulus.  Expecting good radiational cooling tonight with overnight lows in the 20s, except some low to mid 30s near the shoreline.",

Weather influenced by high pressure centered to the SW of our area, as well as dry air from SW mid level flow. Just enough moisture in the low levels to produce some diurnal stratocumulus, mostly sunny skies expected. Low level winds out of the west continue to provide a downsloping component. Temperatures will remain seasonable with highs in the upper 30s to mid 40s, though some locales in the higher terrain of the east slopes of the Berkshires only reach the mid 30s.  Thursday night...  Dry and cold weather expected Thu night with weak surface ridging and continued SW mid level flow. Our area is in between low pressure systems, one to the NW over the Great Lakes region, and another well to the S. Mostly clear to partly cloudy skies along with light winds should allow for overnight lows in the upper teens and 20s. Could see somewhat less cold lows in the low to mid 30s along some portions of the shoreline.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...  425 PM update...  Highlights...  * Seasons 1st snowfall possible Fri ngt/Sat but details uncertain * Chilly with a few snow showers possible Sunday * Potential coastal storm may bring rain/snow to the region next   Tue/Wed followed by bitter cold  Friday...  Sunshine to begin the day but mid and high clouds on the increase as approaching mid level trough over the OH valley in the morning advances eastward and backs the mid level flow. This allows offshore moisture to advect northeast into southern New England during the day from south to north. All model guidance suggest precip may come onshore toward nightfall across Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard. Model soundings across this area suggest blyr may be too warm for all snow at the onset, so a mix of rain and snow possible.  Regarding temps, chilly airmass over the region with -8C at 850 mb and -4C at 925 mb 18z Friday. Model sounding suggest mixing heights almost to 850 mb so highs should range from the upper 30s to lower 40s.  These temps are a few degs colder than normal for early Dec. Mid 40s possible along the south coast given southwest winds streaming across the relatively warm ocean waters that are in the mid to upper 40s.  Friday night thru Saturday night...  Still lots of uncertainty regarding how far northwest deep moisture and lift track from offshore frontal wave. Most of the deterministic guidance including 12z NAM/GFS/EC/Ukmet and GEFS ensembles place sharp qpf gradient over RI and southeast MA. The 12z Euro ensembles are a bit farther inland from southeast CT across RI into eastern MA. Keep in mind average model error at this time range (60-84 hrs) is about 125 miles! Thus risk for accumulating snow ranges from eastern CT to the Worcester Hills into northeast MA (northwest edge of envelope of solutions) to offshore (eastern most edge of solutions), including areas in between. To further complicate the forecast blyr and surface temps may be too warm for an all snow event over the Cape and Islands, so rain may lower the snowfall potential here. Therefore lots of uncertainty continues. Hence important to keep this portion of the forecast probabilistic rather than deterministic as all potential outcomes remain in play.  As previous forecaster mention it will come down to trough amplification entering the Great Lakes late Sat/Sat night. Tracing back the jet energy that will carve out this mid level trough was coming onshore to Alaska this morning. Unfortunately 12z upper air soundings are no longer available across the state of Alaska. This may result in a different model trend beginning with tonight`s 00z guidance as this jet energy becomes better sampled by more 00z upper air soundings along with increased aircraft data at 00z vs 12z.  Sunday...  Potent mid level trough moves across the area with strong forcing for ascent. Steep lapse rates develop in response to -34C at 500 mb moving over the area. However limiting factor here is lack of deep layer moisture. This should limit areal coverage of any snow showers to isolated for widely scattered. Chilly, about 5-8 degs colder than normal with highs 35-40. It will becoming windy during the evening with the trough passage.  Monday through Wednesday ...  Monday with begin very cold start with lows in the teens and 20s. Dry weather likely prevails. Highs probably only recovering to 35- 40, possibly into the 40s along the south coast as winds become southwest. Around Tue arctic front drops southward with cyclogenesis developing along or ahead of the front. Large model spread here on location/timing of potential coastal/ocean low. Much more certain southern periphery of arctic air overspreading the region mid week with 850 temps falling to -16C to -20C!",

Highlights...  * Dry and seasonably cool Thu * Season`s first snowfall possible (albeit light) late Fri into Sat * Temps a bit colder than normal Friday into early next week * POTENTIAL for a significant coastal storm next Tue/Wed  Details...  Thursday...  Looks fairly pleasant for early December with forecast area in between two frontal boundaries. Tonight`s front will be well offshore by Thu and a trailing cold front remains across the eastern Great Lakes into Ontario and Quebec. So a seasonably cool airmass in place over southern New England with 850 mb temps around -8C and -2C at 925 mb. Model soundings support mixing up to 850 mb or so and this will support highs in the 40s except upper 30s high terrain, which is near normal for this time of year. Modest CAA and pgrad will generate west winds 10-20 mph. Model moisture fields suggest SCT-BKN diurnal CU likely with more clouds across northwest MA/hilly terrain and more sunshine in the coastal plain. Overall, typical early Dec day with a mix of sun and clouds, modest west wind and seasonably cool temps.  Friday/Saturday...  Deterministic and ensembles guidance beginning to converge on a more positively tilted/sheared trough across the northeast for this time period. This suggest a series of weak waves of low pressure tracking offshore but possibly close enough to bring a period of snow to RI and southeast MA, especially Cape Cod and the Islands from late Fri into Sat. QPF looks to be a few tenths, so preliminary snow accums looks like the risk for a few inches. However blyr temps are marginal to support snow and given light qpf, snow intensity would likely be light as well, suggesting daytime accumulations may be confined to the colder surfaces. Thus expecting a low impact event here. Farther inland the risk for snow accums diminish from southeast to northwest. Although for whatever reason the GEFS appears to far northwest with its qpf field given the positively tilted/sheared mid level trough. Temps slightly colder than normal given airmass, cloud cover and precip. Highs mainly in the upper 30s and lower 40s, mid 30s northwest MA in the higher terrain. Temps will be slightly lower while precip is falling.  Sunday/Monday...  Colder air arrives Sunday with trailing/secondary short wave trough. Could be some snow showers with this trough given amplitude, some mid level moisture and instability from falling H5 temps. Core of cold air arrives Sun night with 850 temps falling to about -14C across southern New England.  Tuesday/Wednesday...

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/... 4 pm update...  This evening/Tonight...  Warm front was struggling to push northward thru the area this afternoon. Based on surface obs at 3 pm, the front had nudged northward to the CT/MA line and SE thru PVD. The warm front is expected to accelerate northward during this evening as the 925 LLJ significantly increases.  Areas of fog had also developed late this afternoon, with the lower visibilities north of the warm front. Anticipating some fog for the overnight, but the lower vsbys should improve some once the front lifts north and better mixing occurs.  Showers producing light QPF amounts will continue to cross our area early this evening, then rain coverage and intensity is expected to increase as cold front approaches from the west. Temperatures during the overnight hours are expected to rise into the 50s across most of the area. This milder air accompanied by the showers will aid in mixing some of the stronger winds aloft. Regarding strength of the winds, the area most at risk for seeing Wind Advisory criteria is across east coastal MA and across RI, where the 925 mb LLJ increases to 60-70 kts. Have issued a Wind Advisory for tonight for this area, gusts peaking out at 40-50 mph.  With strong forcing and deep moisture, a widespread rainfall is expected across southern New England along and ahead of the cold front. Precipitable water increases to around 1.25 inches, which is 2-3 STD above normal. This will allow for periods of moderate to locally heavy rain as the front crosses thru the area. Looking at rainfall totals ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 inches. There is a chance for some minor poor drainage flooding. There is also the potential for a rumble of thunder here or there, but confidence is too low to place in the forecast for any given location.  Expect the cold front to push thru western areas around or shortly after midnight tonight, then passing thru the BOS-PVD corridor by 12Z. The back edge of the precip should be over the Cape and Islands by 12Z.",

Scattered showers in the vicinity of the Cape and Islands come to an end by late morning, with dry conditions and increasing sunshine to follow.

High temps around daybreak for much of the region, in the mid 40s-low 50s, except nearly steady temps in the 30s and low 40s across the far interior. Gusty NW winds near 20 mph expected due to strong mixing. Cold enough for ocean effect clouds though W/NW winds will limit fetch, still may have some stratocumulus around on the outer Cape/Nantucket.  Wednesday night...  Dry and seasonably chilly weather under a NW flow and mostly clear to partly cloudy skies. Overnight lows in the 20s for most locales, except some low-mid 30s along the shoreline.",

Highlights...  * Dry and seasonably cool Thu * Season`s first snowfall possible (albeit light) late Fri into Sat * Temps a bit colder than normal Friday into early next week * POTENTIAL for a significant coastal storm next Tue/Wed  Details...  Thursday...  Looks fairly pleasant for early December with forecast area in between two frontal boundaries. Tonight`s front will be well offshore by Thu and a trailing cold front remains across the eastern Great Lakes into Ontario and Quebec. So a seasonably cool airmass in place over southern New England with 850 mb temps around -8C and -2C at 925 mb. Model soundings support mixing up to 850 mb or so and this will support highs in the 40s except upper 30s high terrain, which is near normal for this time of year. Modest CAA and pgrad will generate west winds 10-20 mph. Model moisture fields suggest SCT-BKN diurnal CU likely with more clouds across northwest MA/hilly terrain and more sunshine in the coastal plain. Overall, typical early Dec day with a mix of sun and clouds, modest west wind and seasonably cool temps.  Friday/Saturday...  Deterministic and ensembles guidance beginning to converge on a more positively tilted/sheared trough across the northeast for this time period. This suggest a series of weak waves of low pressure tracking offshore but possibly close enough to bring a period of snow to RI and southeast MA, especially Cape Cod and the Islands from late Fri into Sat. QPF looks to be a few tenths, so preliminary snow accums looks like the risk for a few inches. However blyr temps are marginal to support snow and given light qpf, snow intensity would likely be light as well, suggesting daytime accumulations may be confined to the colder surfaces. Thus expecting a low impact event here. Farther inland the risk for snow accums diminish from southeast to northwest. Although for whatever reason the GEFS appears to far northwest with its qpf field given the positively tilted/sheared mid level trough. Temps slightly colder than normal given airmass, cloud cover and precip. Highs mainly in the upper 30s and lower 40s, mid 30s northwest MA in the higher terrain. Temps will be slightly lower while precip is falling.  Sunday/Monday...  Colder air arrives Sunday with trailing/secondary short wave trough. Could be some snow showers with this trough given amplitude, some mid level moisture and instability from falling H5 temps. Core of cold air arrives Sun night with 850 temps falling to about -14C across southern New England.  Tuesday/Wednesday...  Deterministic and ensemble guidance all agree on a very amplified northern stream this time period as a piece of the polar vortex dives southward into Ontario/NY state and finally New England.

As of 10 am scattered light showers were developing and moving thru Long Island and CT. Anticipate these scattered showers continuing to develop and moving further north during late this morning and this afternoon. No changes to POPs. Updated hourly temp and dew point forecast to reflect latest trends. Forecast max temps look on track at this time.  Early morning discussion follows...  Early morning temps mainly in the upper 30s and lower 40s, but there were still some 20s across portions of southeast MA. These cold temps across southeast MA should rise significantly over the next 1 to 3 hours as low level jet increases and allows milder air to mix down from above.  Mid-level ridge over the region will push offshore as potent shortwave digs into the Great Lakes. At the surface, a warm front will slowly push through the region resulting in a more southerly flow for the day. Low-level jet will begin to increase during the afternoon which may result in some mixing behind the warm front. This is noted in upstream obs where southerly winds have increased to 20-30 mph.  Temperatures will slowly warm through the day, where some sites may reach into the lower to middle 50s by late in the afternoon. Spots across northern MA may be jammed up in the 40s for most of the day, until LLJ really increases. Thus went with 2m temps for the day with hi- res guidance to show the meso-scale details.  Aside from temps and wind, the focus turns to rain chances for today. While strongest forcing remains to our west today, increasing LLJ and warm advection will lead to some hit and miss showers mainly this afternoon but a few may impact the interior by late morning. This is shown in hi-res guidance and thus try to implement the showery nature within the grids. Because low level moisture will increase and dewpoints warm into the 50s, may have to watch for patchy fog by the afternoon/early evening hours. Confidence is low at this time.  Coastal Flooding: Astronomical high tides will occur late this morning into the early afternoon. Anticipate splashover and minor coastal flooding across vulnerable shorelines. More details below.",

This will help increase mixing across the region which could result in wind gusts 40-50 MPH. Models appear to be struggling with this potential. But looking at NCAR ensembles and CIPS analogs, confidence is increasing in strong gusty winds especially across the MA southeast coastal plain. Contemplated issuing a wind advisory as LLJ does increase well over 60kts. But still a bit tricky on how much will truly mix down thus will hold off and let the day crew have another look.  Aside from gusty winds, widespread rainfall will occur along and ahead of the front. Strong forcing with a very moist environment and deep layer moisture across the region. In fact, PWATs increase to over 1.2 inches which is 2-3 STD above normal. This amount of moisture in Dec will help rainfall amounts be near an inch with some spots receiving over 1.5 inches.

Highs on Thu mainly in the lower to middle 40s with some upper 30s possible across the interior high terrain.  Friday/Saturday/Sunday...  Tremendous uncertainty in this portion of the forecast as a strong northern stream shortwave drops south into the Great Lakes.  This will help to carve out a deep trough to our west.  Several pieces of shortwave energy will round the base of the trough along with a couple weak waves of low pressure.  Timing/strength/location of associated shortwave energy and surface reflections are extremely uncertain at this point.  Numerous possible outcomes and scenarios are possible Friday into the weekend.  If the shortwave energy is on the weaker side and trough amplification is limited most of Fri/Sat/Sun will be dry with just a few brief passing rain/snow showers.  Stronger shortwave energy would carve out a more negatively tilted trough and a better chance for a wave or two of low pressure to track closer to the coast.  This would bring a bigger threat for a period or two of rain and/or accumulating snow with ptype determined by the exact track. Keep in mind this is 4+ days into the future and specific outcomes are highly uncertain.  While it is far from set it stone, the potential for some locations to receive their first measurable snowfall exists sometime Friday into the weekend.  As for temps, they should average a bit below normal Fri/Sat/Sun but the bitter cold air should remain to our northwest. High temps Fri/Sat/Sun will mainly be in the 30s to around 40.  Monday...

In fact, temps have already begun to rise as WAA aloft has already increased per SPC meso analysis. Locations across southeast MA, Cape and Islands are a bit slower as clear skies and light winds results in radiational cooling. Once clouds fill in, temps will remain steady, or warm a few degrees.

Timing/strength/location of associated shortwave energy and surface reflections are extremely uncertain at this point.  Numerous possible outcomes and scenarios are possible Friday into the weekend.  If the shortwave energy is on the weaker side and trough amplification is limited most of Fri/Sat/Sun will be dry with just a few brief passing rain/snow showers.  Stronger shortwave energy would carve out a more negatively tilted trough and a better chance for a wave or two of low pressure to track closer to the coast.  This would bring a bigger threat for a period or two of rain and/or accumulating snow with ptype determined by the exact track. Keep in mind this is 4+ days into the future and specific outcomes are highly uncertain.  While it is far from set it stone, the potential for some locations to receive their first measurable snowfall exists sometime Friday into the weekend.  As for temps, they should average a bit below normal Fri/Sat/Sun but the bitter cold air should remain to our northwest. High temps Fri/Sat/Sun will mainly be in the 30s to around 40.  Monday...  Chilly weather continues with dry weather likely dominating, but a few brief rain/snow showers can not be ruled out with some shortwave energy.  High temps mainly in the 30s to the lower 40s.",

This will help build seas to over 10 feet across the ocean waters tonight. 35-40 kt gusts are likely this evening and into the overnight hours and thus have upgraded the gale watch to warning. Southerly winds will switch to the west by Wednesday morning and begin to decrease resulting in seas relaxing. SCA will be needed for this timeframe.

    "tides": ".TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING...  Astronomical high tides will occur today and Wednesday. Currently, the region is seeing a .2-0.5 ft surge, with hardly any wind this morning. Approaching frontal system today will help back the winds to a more south/southeast direction and begin to increase as LLJ strengthens. This will help increase the surge and waves during the afternoon and into the overnight hours.  For the south coast, high tide will occur during the mid- morning hours yet wind will not truly strengthen quite yet. The evening high tide will be lower than todays, but with the stronger winds could see 1-2 foot surge but will keep the region just shy of advisory. My need a coastal flood statement.  East coast locations will be a bit more vulnerable as high tides will occur this afternoon. Boston will approach 12.3 feet and with winds turning more to the southeast, could see an additional 0.5-1 foot surge. Winds also begin to increase this afternoon which could increase the surge. This will result in coastal issues especially for vulnerable locations. A coastal flood advisory has been issued for today."

Widespread rain moves through our area late Tuesday and Wednesday, then will taper off during Wednesday as the cold front moves offshore. Dry and cooler conditions return Thursday into Friday. Weak lows will move along a stalled front east of New England, which may bring a glancing blow of light rain and/or snow across parts of the region late Friday into next weekend. Temperatures will run near or slightly below seasonal normals late this week through the upcoming weekend.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/...  1030 PM Update...  High pressure to the east has begun to slowly move to the northeast as warm front from the west begins to approach. Surface winds are beginning to turn more to a southerly direction as noted in the latest 03z obs. WAA aloft is beginning to take hold of the region as southwest flow becomes dominate across the region. Temperatures at the surface are already slowly warming at BDL has jumped to 38F. Many locations have already seen their lowest temp and thus the trend is for temps to slowly warm. Several sites have bottomed our into the low 30s to mid 20s. A few sites across southeast MA may drop another degree, but clouds are quickly filling in thus limiting the radiational cooling.  Warm front approaching from the west is currently draped across upstate NY. Mosaic radar is showing some light reflectivity, but obs are not indicating anything is reaching the ground thus expect virga is falling as 00z ALB sounding shows a lot of dry air between 850-700mb. It will take the atmosphere sometime to moisten up within this layer thus will keep most of the overnight dry. Did include some light sprinkles toward the early morning hours tomorrow morning, before the bulk of the moisture moves into the region.  One thing have to watch is the wind gusts behind the warm front tonight. See locations across BUF and SYR are gusting into the 20-30 kts. Will have to watch trends to see if we need to speed up the timing of gusts towards the morning hours.  Previous Discussion...  Expect increasing cloudiness overnight from a couple of sources. Mid and high deck clouds will be moving into southern New England from the west. Then for later tonight as low level winds shift to the SE-S, increasing low level moisture will increase, bringing the potential for development of a low stratus deck. Continue to anticipate dry air between 850 and 700 mb so that expecting the overnight to be generally precipitation free. Limited pops to slight chance for late tonight, across the far interior.  Expect early night lows in the 30s then temps steady or slowly rising as cloud cover increases and winds pick up somewhat.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/... Tuesday...  Northern stream shortwave digs into a closed low over the Great Lakes Region, while high pressure moves further offshore, allowing upper flow over us to orient southwest-to-northeast. Low level winds will draw higher moisture air up from the south. This is expected to lead to overcast skies with developing showers. Have pops increasing to chance during the morning, with rain likely in the mid to late afternoon as 1 inch Precipitable Water values start moving overhead.  The strongest of the south winds are expected to remain aloft, with a low level jet of 40 to 50 kts. However some of that wind is expected to mix to the surface, so towards late afternoon there is the potential for gusts of 25-30 mph, mainly across south coastal MA/RI and immediate east coastal MA.  Tuesday night...  Cold front advances eastward towards southern New England, moving thru much of the region prior to daybreak. Strong winds and moderate rain are expected across southern New England, with pockets of heavier rain possible.  Rainfall...Precipitable water climbs to around 1.25\" ahead of the cold front, roughly +2 standard deviations above normal. The front is expected to make steady eastward progress Tue night. Given the deep moisture and strong forcing with the front, thinking rainfall amounts over an inch are possible prior to 12Z Wed. Possibility for isolated pockets of urban and poor drainage flooding, though for most this rain is needed as the past month has been quite dry, especially away from southeast MA and RI.  Winds...Expecting winds to increase Tue evening as low level jet of 50-70 kts sets up over eastern MA and RI. Thinking that there will be reduced mixing with the warm air advection during the overnight, sustained winds reaching Wind Advisory criteria may be the more likely threat. Continue with thinking that far southeast New England has the best short at reaching Wind Advisory criteria, with potential sustained winds of 30-40 mph. Higher gusts are possible.  Continue to highlight both wind and rain threats in the Hazardous Weather Outlook.  The warm air moving in allows for quite mild temperatures overnight. Went with warmer guidance which has temps climbing into mid and upper 50s for much of the area ahead of the cold front Tue night.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...

Strong cutoff H5 low pressure will spin around Hudson Bay through the remainder of the week, then will lift N toward the Arctic Circle as another cutoff low rotates southward to the Great Lakes by the upcoming weekend. While a general SW flow remains along the eastern seaboard and an H5 long wave trough digs S to the Gulf coast, will see H5 heights slow but steadily lower especially from late this week into the weekend.  With the trough to the W, the stalled front off the SE U.S. coast will start to orient from SW to NE and, as weak waves of low pressure move along it, the northwest periphery of precip may push close enough onshore to bring light precipitation starting later Fri or Fri night through most of the upcoming weekend. With borderline temps, there may be periods of light snow either mixed with the rain or straight light snow during the nighttime hours into the early morning hours of Sat and Sun. Models continue to experience widening solution spread towards the weekend, so exact placement and track of the weak lows and where the stalled front sets up are still very much in question.  Late this weekend into early next week, may see some changes to the overall steering pattern as the upper low lifts further N into James Bay. May see weak short waves rotate in the upper flow that might bring some more light precip. This portion of the forecast is way up in the air, though, as wide variance in track and timing of individual systems continues amongst the model suite and ensembles.  Details...  Wednesday... The cold front will push offshore the east coast by midday Wed, taking the precip shield with it. May see leftover light rain lingering across the Cape and islands into Wed afternoon but should push offshore toward sunset.  Mild temperatures during the pre-dawn hours will slowly fall from late morning onward as colder air starts to seep in across the region. H85 temps will fall back to -3C to -8C by late afternoon across central and western areas. May see some leftover wind gusts up to around 20-25 kt along the S coast through midday as winds shift from SW to W.  Temps peak out prior to sunrise before the front passes, readings during the day will hold in the 40s across far western areas to the lower-mid 50s elsewhere through about midday before starting to fall.  Wednesday night into early Friday... High pres ridge will build in from the SW Wed night, bringing drier air across the region with W winds in place.

Highs will range from the mid-upper 30s well inland to the lower-mid 40s across the coastal plain in Thursday, then a few degrees cooler for Friday.  Friday afternoon into early Sunday... As the upper trough to the W becomes more N-S oriented, will see stalled front along the SE U.S. coast start to shift more to the N-NE. NW periphery of the precip may push into the region. May see light precip fall, but only carried CHC POPs for most if not the entire region by Fri night. The best chance for precip will be along coastal areas, especially Cape Cod and the islands.  With temps falling close to or slightly below freezing each night especially away from the coast, could see some periods of light snow fall which could coat the ground with a light accumulation both Friday night and Saturday night. At this point, precip should push offshore early Sunday, but timing is still in question due to wide model solution spread.  Midday Sunday through Monday...

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/... Highlights...  * Strong cold front sweeps across region late Tue night and Wed * Cool and dry Thursday * Potential continues for coastal low approaching late week   with a possible wintry mix of precip at times  Overview...  Noting amplification of the mid level steering pattern from the central Pacific into the Atlantic to start off the long term period, with cutoff H5 low pressure across Ontario to the southern shore of Hudson Bay. The low retreats to the Arctic Circle, but long wave trough digs southward from the upper Plains states and Great Lakes to near the Gulf coast, as high amplitude ridge builds along the Pacific coast into western Canada by mid to late this week. With the developing long wave blocking pattern, the front tends to stall somewhere off the SE U.S. coast by late week. Low pres may develop and move NE with the long wave S-SW wind flow. The western edge of the precip shield may pass close enough sometime from Friday into the weekend to possibly bring some light rain and/or snow to portions of the region.  There is some question whether the long wave trough breaks down next weekend, which would keep the offshore system and its precipitation shield offshore. Model solution spread coming into play, lending to lower confidence for the later portion of the forecast.  The other question is whether the core of the Arctic air works out of western and central Canada toward the region. This will be dependent upon the position and movement of the H5 cutoff low across central Canada, and whether the heart of the cold air wraps around. The 12Z operational models tending to hold the coldest air out of the region through this period, though pieces of somewhat colder air appear to move in at times. Temps appear to run close to or a bit below seasonal normals at this time.  Details...  Tuesday through Wednesday...  High pres moves to the western Atlantic while the strong cold front works E, with the leading edge of precip moving across during Tuesday. Precip should hold off until mid-late morning across western areas, so temps should be warm enough for precip to be all rain. Best chance for precip occurs Tue night into Wed. CAT POPs in place for this timeframe.  Noting good influx of tropical moisture working NE in the deep S-SW wind flow working up from the Gulf of Mexico, especially across central and eastern areas Tuesday night into Wednesday. PWAT plume works in, with values increasing to around 1.25 inches, close to max PWAT value for 12/6 per SPC sounding climo. Could see around an inch or so of QPF, with most falling Tue night into early Wed.  Pretty good SW low level jet, on order of 40-50 kt at H925 up to 50-60 kt at H85 passing across the region Tue night which increases to 65 kt as it moves into the western Gulf of Maine toward daybreak Wed. Some question how much of this jet will mix down with marginal low level lapse rates in place, but could see some gusts up to 30-40 mph or so. Will need to monitor this aspect for possible wind advisory level gusts, but need higher lapse rates to work in for a shot.  Precip should end from W-E Wed afternoon into Wed evening with somewhat colder air working in.  Temps will run up to around 10 degrees above normal on Tuesday across western areas, then around 10 degrees above over E Mass/RI Wednesday ahead of the front. Readings will top off in the lower-mid 50s, with a few spots in the upper 50s over eastern areas Wed. Overnight lows Tue night will only fall back to the upper 30s well inland, ranging to the upper 40s along the coast.  Thursday...  General W wind flow in place around the base of the surface and upper low over central Canada, with surface ridging building across from the S and W. Expect dry conditions. Highs will range from the lower-mid 30s across the higher inland terrain to the lower 40s across the coastal plain.  Friday through Sunday...  Model solution spread increases during this timeframe at both the surface and aloft. Mid level pattern tries to re-establish the long wave trough out of the Great Lakes to the central Gulf coast by late Fri. The front that passed through stalled along the SE coast and, with the re-amplifying H5 trough, may see low pressure form along the front and try to shift NE. The big question will be how close it will come to the SE Mass coast, which will determine how much moisture will push toward the region and how far inland it will extend. Being on the northern periphery of the precip shield, also some question on PTYPE (rain vs. snow), though it looks like the QPF amounts will be on the low side.  Could see a couple of weak systems move along this front during this timeframe, but a lot of uncertainty at this time.

Temperatures through this period expected to be near normal Monday, and slightly above normal Monday night due to increasing warm air advection.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...  Highlights...  * Strong cold front sweeps across region late Tue night and Wed * Cool and dry Thursday * Potential continues for coastal low approaching late week   with a possible wintry mix of precip at times  Overview...  Noting amplification of the mid level steering pattern from the central Pacific into the Atlantic to start off the long term period, with cutoff H5 low pressure across Ontario to the southern shore of Hudson Bay. The low retreats to the Arctic Circle, but long wave trough digs southward from the upper Plains states and Great Lakes to near the Gulf coast, as high amplitude ridge builds along the Pacific coast into western Canada by mid to late this week. With the developing long wave blocking pattern, the front tends to stall somewhere off the SE U.S. coast by late week. Low pres may develop and move NE with the long wave S-SW wind flow. The western edge of the precip shield may pass close enough sometime from Friday into the weekend to possibly bring some light rain and/or snow to portions of the region.  There is some question whether the long wave trough breaks down next weekend, which would keep the offshore system and its precipitation shield offshore. Model solution spread coming into play, lending to lower confidence for the later portion of the forecast.  The other question is whether the core of the Arctic air works out of western and central Canada toward the region. This will be dependent upon the position and movement of the H5 cutoff low across central Canada, and whether the heart of the cold air wraps around. The 12Z operational models tending to hold the coldest air out of the region through this period, though pieces of somewhat colder air appear to move in at times. Temps appear to run close to or a bit below seasonal normals at this time.  Details...  Tuesday through Wednesday...  High pres moves to the western Atlantic while the strong cold front works E, with the leading edge of precip moving across during Tuesday. Precip should hold off until mid-late morning across western areas, so temps should be warm enough for precip to be all rain. Best chance for precip occurs Tue night into Wed. CAT POPs in place for this timeframe.  Noting good influx of tropical moisture working NE in the deep S-SW wind flow working up from the Gulf of Mexico, especially across central and eastern areas Tuesday night into Wednesday. PWAT plume works in, with values increasing to around 1.25 inches, close to max PWAT value for 12/6 per SPC sounding climo. Could see around an inch or so of QPF, with most falling Tue night into early Wed.  Pretty good SW low level jet, on order of 40-50 kt at H925 up to 50-60 kt at H85 passing across the region Tue night which increases to 65 kt as it moves into the western Gulf of Maine toward daybreak Wed. Some question how much of this jet will mix down with marginal low level lapse rates in place, but could see some gusts up to 30-40 mph or so. Will need to monitor this aspect for possible wind advisory level gusts, but need higher lapse rates to work in for a shot.  Precip should end from W-E Wed afternoon into Wed evening with somewhat colder air working in.  Temps will run up to around 10 degrees above normal on Tuesday across western areas, then around 10 degrees above over E Mass/RI Wednesday ahead of the front. Readings will top off in the lower-mid 50s, with a few spots in the upper 50s over eastern areas Wed. Overnight lows Tue night will only fall back to the upper 30s well inland, ranging to the upper 40s along the coast.  Thursday...  General W wind flow in place around the base of the surface and upper low over central Canada, with surface ridging building across from the S and W. Expect dry conditions. Highs will range from the lower-mid 30s across the higher inland terrain to the lower 40s across the coastal plain.  Friday through Sunday...  Model solution spread increases during this timeframe at both the surface and aloft. Mid level pattern tries to re-establish the long wave trough out of the Great Lakes to the central Gulf coast by late Fri. The front that passed through stalled along the SE coast and, with the re-amplifying H5 trough, may see low pressure form along the front and try to shift NE. The big question will be how close it will come to the SE Mass coast, which will determine how much moisture will push toward the region and how far inland it will extend. Being on the northern periphery of the precip shield, also some question on PTYPE (rain vs. snow), though it looks like the QPF amounts will be on the low side.  Could see a couple of weak systems move along this front during this timeframe, but a lot of uncertainty at this time. Have mainly CHC POPs going for now, but did briefly carry LKLY POP for Nantucket Fri night. At this point, temps are forecast to run close to or slightly below normal.",

Radar echoes across southern VT and NH were not really reaching the ground, so far. Lots of dry air to overcome in the 850-650 mb layer.  Previous Discussion...  Shortwave over western NY sweeps east across New England today, bringing an upper cold pool with -28C air at 500 mb as well as a pool of shallow moisture between 850 and 925 mb. This should bring mostly cloudy skies much of the day, but insufficient lift or moisture depth to consider precipitation.  Western edge of the cloud shield was near Toronto at 3 AM, and trending east at a pace that would bring it to the CT River Valley around 21-22Z/4-5PM and to the coastal plain roughly 00Z- 02Z/7-9PM.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Seasonable and quiet Monday night  - Sweeping cold front Tuesday through Wednesday, windy and wet  - Cool and dry Thursday  - Potential skirting coastal storm Friday, rain / snow mix  */ Overview...  From midweek till the foreseeable future we will find ourselves in a cooler, more active pattern. Fairly apparent and well known, will go with a short and sweet overview. N Pacific split flow with MJO phase 5-6 implications as energy piles up over the N Atlantic buckles the flow across N America creating a high amplitude ridge-trof pattern. Warm air surging towards the pole, both Arctic air and energy are displaced at times as individual impulses sweep S/E through the H5 trof over Central/E N America, bottling up and slowed over E/SE Canada as there`s little room to escape across the N Atlantic.  A couple of things to touch upon...  1.) Arctic air magnitude. Separated from colder Siberian air, Arctic origins not so negatively anomalous. In addition, preferred region of development over E/SE Canada, reloading shots of colder air will only moderate with time S/E across mostly bare ground within the CONUS. For the NE CONUS likely not dealing with an Arctic blast but rather conditions that are slightly below seasonable (highs in the low 40s, lows around the upper 20s).  2.) Individual disturbances. Apparent that individual waves through the aforementioned H5 trof will reload colder air S/E. However what is not well known is how individual waves evolve and respond, how they modify the H5 trof ( steepness / amplitude / tilt ) and as to what draw and amplification individually they bring about in respect to conveyor belt motions / thermal wind response as they rotate thru the flow. Isn`t with any certainty that we`ll see an east coast snow storm for those wish-casting. Especially from 120 hours and beyond, run to run model guidance continues to sway such that little to no confidence can be gained. Have to wait and see how things evolve with later forecast guidance.  Per verification, only confident with model forecasts roughly 96-108 hours out, with preference to the EC / UKmet. Quiet through Monday night. Rain moving in Tuesday, the heaviest Tuesday night into the early half of Wednesday along with the threat of strong to damaging winds and a possible rumble of thunder associated with a sweeping anafrontal cold front behind which there is the possibility of rain changing to snow, clearing out late Wednesday behind which cool air begins to slide in. Dry Thursday (120 hours out),  */ Discussion...  Monday night...  Quiet. High pressure still lurking. Winds becoming S. Clouds on the increase. Milder S/W, colder N/E. Lows around the low 30s.  Tuesday through Wednesday...  Cold front sweeping the region ahead of the main mid-level vortmax thus obtaining anafrontal characteristics as sub-tropical moisture ascends back behind the undercutting colder air. Couple of things to note:  1.) Precipitation onset. Continued low risk of spotty, light showers towards Tuesday morning at which point sub-freezing air may remain trapped within sheltered valleys of N MA thus presenting the threat of freezing rain / drizzle. Ensemble probabilities of 0.01 continue to signal wet-weather arriving after 12z Tuesday. Dominance of drier air and subsidence within the mid-levels from the retreating high, however signals within high-res guidance of weak isentropic upslope round the high off the warmer, moist NE Atlantic contributing to the spotty, light showery weather. Prevail with a slight chance for a brief period of freezing rain over N MA around 12z Tuesday.  2.) Strong to damaging S/SW winds, Tuesday night. Warm air advection (WAA) in advance brought about by strong SW flow. Leaning with highs into the 50s, closer shot to 60 early Wednesday before temperatures drop. Tightening thermal gradient up against colder air surging rear- ward. Sharpening frontal boundary, thermal wind response, subsequent H925 jet exceeding 60 mph. Increasing probability per ensemble means of wind gusts exceeding 40 mph, potentially 50 mph, over S/SE New England mainly around Wednesday. WAA loft could limit the mixing threat, potentially a shallow nocturnal inversion with cold frontal passage progged around 12z Wednesday, the strongest winds occurring Tuesday night. However gradient wind response can`t be ignored. WIND ADVISORY headlines could be met with sustained winds in excess of 30 mph alone. Will continue to highlight the threat in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK and adjust grids Tuesday night with sustained winds closer to 35 mph and gusts to 45 mph.  3.) Change over to snow behind the cold front. Noted earlier, a cold front with anafrontal characteristics with the main mid-level ascent and associated vortmax rearward. Along 290-300K isentropic surfaces seeing westward drawback of moisture from an anticyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt above undercutting colder air. However, a strong dry punch to the rear and the magnitude of the cold air in tow given now a daytime passage with partial clearing forecast, change over threat to snow is subdued along with confidence of any snow accumulations. Perhaps a few wet snowflakes in the N/W high terrain. Ensemble mean probabilities have exceptionally dialed back with respect to 1-inch snowfalls in a 24-hour period, signaling a chance over N/W MA.  It`s going to rain. Widespread with embedded heavier showers, can`t rule out a rumble of thunder given the moist, theta-E profile from the sub-tropics, conditionally unstable. Precipitable waters over 1.25 inches, +2 standard deviations. Rainfall amounts around 0.75 inches expected, some locations coming in around an inch, ensemble means signaling the CT River Valley especially. Quick moving cold front, less a flood threat, however can`t rule out poor-drainage issues. Keep a close eye on later forecasts with respect to high-res guidance.  Thursday...  Keep it cool and dry. Consistent run-to-run signals of weak ridging between two impulses. W winds prevailing.  Friday onward...  Potential coastal storm Friday into Saturday. Seemingly quick moving as an open wave, skirting S/E New England especially, rain/snow mix possible, dependence on timing passage, daytime or nocturnal. Model forecast guidance continues to waffle, including the preferred EC / UKmet, a low confidence forecast. Additional coastal storms are possible, however specifics are highly uncertain given perturbations in the flow that are poorly forecast so far out in time.

High pressure remains across New England, extending down to the mid Atlantic coast, though will see a mix of some sunshine mixed with the clouds through the day.  Near term forecast looks pretty much on track, but have updated to bring conditions current.  Previous discussion...  High pressure over New England will bring light wind and dry weather to the region. At the same time, two shortwaves in the northern stream will move east along the northern tier of states.  The first shortwave is quite shallow, but accompanied by a 90-knot upper jet as both cross Northern New England today.

The main uncertainty is coverage, as IR imagery can imply greater thickness to approaching high clouds than actually exists. We have opted for the higher coverage sky cover values shown in the blended model data. The highest values will be north of the Mass Pike.

Pattern change. Energy piling up across the N Atlantic evolving into a rex-block setup. N Pacific split flow regime with MJO implications as it transitions through a moderate phase 4 to phase 5/6 surging warm-moist air into NW N America. The pattern buckles, becoming high amplitude, displacing both Arctic air and energy S over Central and E N America, bottling up and slowed as there`s little room to escape across the N Atlantic. From midweek till the foreseeable future we will find ourselves in a colder, more active pattern.  Touching on a few points. Let`s for simplicity assume that we are going to be dealing with Arctic air that`ll lend to below-average temperatures beyond Thursday. Likely we`ll see moderation of the airmass as it pours S even as it continually gets reloaded by the continual presence of low pressure over E Canada dipping down into the NE CONUS. But overall, 2m temperatures are going to likely be below seasonable levels for early December averaged out over time. The bigger point to touch upon as was alluded to in the \"reloading\" discussed above is the expectation of continuous individual waves through the H5 ridge-trof pattern across the CONUS. Particularly with the H5 trof over Central/E N America, closely need to monitor the contortions and connections of individual waves, that is to say how it modifies the H5 trof (steepness / amplitude / tilt) and as to what draw and amplification individually they bring about in respect to conveyor belt motions / thermal wind response as they rotate thru the flow. Such small details will need to be critiqued, the smallest inferences to be made, but at this point in time, so far out in the forecast run to run model guidance sways such that little confidence can be gained. Can`t jump on an individual piece of model guidance and proclaim there`s going to be an east coast storm. As stated in earlier forecast discussions, there`s a lot of moving parts and a of subsequent uncertainty. Case in point, note the waffling within the last 5 operational EC forecasts (30.0z to 02.0z) for the late week into early next week timeframe with respect to potential east coast storm development.  Seasonable and quiet through Monday night beneath high pressure. Ana- frontal cold front sweeping the area Tuesday through Wednesday night with likely change-over to snow on the backside. Cool and dry into Friday and then thereafter its highly uncertain.  Per 96-120 hr verification forecasts, EC and UKmet exceed the GFS with respect to both H5 and surface fields. Preference weighted to the two with greater weight towards the EC. Forecast considerations with respect to threats and impacts touched upon in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Sunday night through Monday night...  High pressure. Seasonable conditions. Dry. Highs in the 40s, lows in the 30s. Breezy N winds still remain possible along the E coast and keeping high astronomical tides in mind there are potential impacts for vulnerable shoreline roads. See TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING section below for more details.  Tuesday through Wednesday Night...  Cold front sweeping the region ahead of the main mid-level vortmax thus obtaining anafrontal characteristics as sub-tropical moisture ascends back behind the undercutting colder air. Couple of things to note:  1.) Precipitation onset. Earlier thinking that perhaps Tuesday morn precipitation could start off as freezing rain for the N/W interior of MA (especially sheltered valleys). Associated airmass with high pressure from a S-stream and precipitation onset could be delayed until later Tuesday. Ensemble probabilities of 0.01 by 12z Tuesday have trimmed back. Growing confidence of a lesser threat. Leaning towards precipitation starting later Tuesday and beginning all as rain. As the prior forecaster noted, there is still subsidence that is occurring within the column given the dominance of the ridge of high pressure in place sliding E giving the opportunity to warm above 32F at the surface prior to precipitation onset, lower risk of freezing rain.  2.) Strong to damaging S winds. Warm air advection (WAA) in advance brought about by strong SW flow. Leaning with highs into the 50s, closer shot to 60 Wednesday. Tightening thermal gradient up against colder air surging rearward. Strong, sharpening frontal boundary, likely thermal wind response, indications of a strong H925-85 low- level jet exceeding 60 mph. A growing probability from ensemble probabilistics of wind gusts exceeding 40 mph, potentially 50 mph, over S/SE New England mainly around Wednesday. WAA loft could limit the mixing threat, however gradient wind response can`t be ignored. WIND ADVISORY headlines could be met with sustained winds in excess of 30 mph alone.  3.) Change over to snow behind the cold front. Noted earlier, a cold front with anafrontal characteristics with the main mid-level ascent and associated vortmax rearward. Along 290-300K isentropic surfaces seeing westward drawback of moisture from an anticyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt above undercutting colder air. Ensemble probabilistics slightly higher with respect to 1 and 3 inch accumulations over N/W areas of S New England. Greater confidence of seeing rain changing over to snow behind the sweeping front given probabilities and noted synoptics. Amounts may not be much if the first in a series of vort- maxes, as noted by the previous forecaster, drags in drier air quick and pushes the cold front out readily. Likely modifications in later forecasts with respect to timing and outcomes.  Overall, likely PoPs. Widespread rain with embedded heavier showers, possible rumble of thunder given the moist, theta-E profile from the sub-tropics, conditionally unstable. Precipitable waters over 1.25 inches, +2 standard deviations, anomalous. Expect rainfall totals over 1-inch, locally higher. Quick moving cold front, lesser of a flood threat, however can`t rule out poor-drainage issues. Pushing S winds higher, with potential 30 to 40 mph gusts. Changeover to snow on the backside, forecasting around 1-inch accumulations for N/W areas of S New England.  Thursday onward...  Keep it cold and dry through Friday. Then thereafter a high level of uncertainty. As noted above, operational EC forecast guidance the last several runs has flopped on a potential east coast storm. A lot of moving parts, can hardly touch on any specifics. Still certain, however, that temperatures will be below seasonable.",

Such small details will need to be critiqued, the smallest inferences to be made, but at this point in time, so far out in the forecast run to run model guidance sways such that little confidence can be gained. Can`t jump on an individual piece of model guidance and proclaim there`s going to be an east coast storm. As stated in earlier forecast discussions, there`s a lot of moving parts and a of subsequent uncertainty. Case in point, note the waffling within the last 5 operational EC forecasts (30.0z to 02.0z) for the late week into early next week timeframe with respect to potential east coast storm development.  Seasonable and quiet through Monday night beneath high pressure. Ana- frontal cold front sweeping the area Tuesday through Wednesday night with likely change-over to snow on the backside. Cool and dry into Friday and then thereafter its highly uncertain.  Per 96-120 hr verification forecasts, EC and UKmet exceed the GFS with respect to both H5 and surface fields. Preference weighted to the two with greater weight towards the EC. Forecast considerations with respect to threats and impacts touched upon in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Sunday night through Monday night...  High pressure. Seasonable conditions. Dry. Highs in the 40s, lows in the 30s. Breezy N winds still remain possible along the E coast and keeping high astronomical tides in mind there are potential impacts for vulnerable shoreline roads. See TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING section below for more details.  Tuesday through Wednesday Night...  Cold front sweeping the region ahead of the main mid-level vortmax thus obtaining anafrontal characteristics as sub-tropical moisture ascends back behind the undercutting colder air. Couple of things to note:  1.) Precipitation onset. Earlier thinking that perhaps Tuesday morn precipitation could start off as freezing rain for the N/W interior of MA (especially sheltered valleys). Associated airmass with high pressure from a S-stream and precipitation onset could be delayed until later Tuesday. Ensemble probabilities of 0.01 by 12z Tuesday have trimmed back. Growing confidence of a lesser threat. Leaning towards precipitation starting later Tuesday and beginning all as rain. As the prior forecaster noted, there is still subsidence that is occurring within the column given the dominance of the ridge of high pressure in place sliding E giving the opportunity to warm above 32F at the surface prior to precipitation onset, lower risk of freezing rain.  2.) Strong to damaging S winds. Warm air advection (WAA) in advance brought about by strong SW flow. Leaning with highs into the 50s, closer shot to 60 Wednesday. Tightening thermal gradient up against colder air surging rearward. Strong, sharpening frontal boundary, likely thermal wind response, indications of a strong H925-85 low- level jet exceeding 60 mph. A growing probability from ensemble probabilistics of wind gusts exceeding 40 mph, potentially 50 mph, over S/SE New England mainly around Wednesday. WAA loft could limit the mixing threat, however gradient wind response can`t be ignored. WIND ADVISORY headlines could be met with sustained winds in excess of 30 mph alone.  3.) Change over to snow behind the cold front. Noted earlier, a cold front with anafrontal characteristics with the main mid-level ascent and associated vortmax rearward. Along 290-300K isentropic surfaces seeing westward drawback of moisture from an anticyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt above undercutting colder air. Ensemble probabilistics slightly higher with respect to 1 and 3 inch accumulations over N/W areas of S New England. Greater confidence of seeing rain changing over to snow behind the sweeping front given probabilities and noted synoptics. Amounts may not be much if the first in a series of vort- maxes, as noted by the previous forecaster, drags in drier air quick and pushes the cold front out readily. Likely modifications in later forecasts with respect to timing and outcomes.  Overall, likely PoPs. Widespread rain with embedded heavier showers, possible rumble of thunder given the moist, theta-E profile from the sub-tropics, conditionally unstable. Precipitable waters over 1.25 inches, +2 standard deviations, anomalous. Expect rainfall totals over 1-inch, locally higher. Quick moving cold front, lesser of a flood threat, however can`t rule out poor-drainage issues. Pushing S winds higher, with potential 30 to 40 mph gusts. Changeover to snow on the backside, forecasting around 1-inch accumulations for N/W areas of S New England.  Thursday onward...  Keep it cold and dry through Friday. Then thereafter a high level of uncertainty. As noted above, operational EC forecast guidance the last several runs has flopped on a potential east coast storm. A lot of moving parts, can hardly touch on any specifics. Still certain, however, that temperatures will be below seasonable.",

Although the pattern begins zonal Sun, still anticipating a transition toward high amplification toward the middle of next week. This is thanks to a building block across the E coast into the Maritimes. Forcing the upstream wave moving out of the Aleutian region to phase with arctic vortex which currently resides W of Hudson Bay. The resulting longwave trof settles across the W Great Lakes initially and then, through late week, the axis really only shifts as far E as the Mississippi. Therefore, echo the previous forecasters note that the core of the cold air remains generally to our W, suggesting that while a transition to cooler wx is likely, it will only be seasonably cool through next weekend. Regarding the timing of this transition, there remains some differences in how quickly the wave deepens, with the ECMWF leading the way but then slowing, the GFS slowest, the CMC in the middle and several ensemble members fall within these envelopes. Therefore, will continue to lean most heavily on ensemble means to take into account the timing uncertainty.  Details...  Sun and Mon... While a very weak open wave moves across the region Sun, it does so with little fanfare as the column remains mostly dry. Only a few clouds are generally expected. Following this, rapid ridge building begins to form a Rex-like block downstream. This will allow for the maintenance of high pres across New England, with manly dry conditions. The lower column is relatively isothermal per bufkit, with both H85 and H92 temps holding near 0C to +1C through the period. With equal, but limited mixing, expecting highs near to slightly above seasonal normals, mainly in the mid and upper 40s while lows drop to the mid 20s to low 30s.  Tue and Wed... Ridging continues to be the dominant feature defining sensible wx through Tue as it continues to build just to the E of New England and into the Maritimes. Although weak warm frontal nose pushes in, and some guidance supports light QPF, feel it warrants only slight to low chance POPs for SHRA as strong subsidence is apparent in soundings, influence from the ridge. Also, this lowers the risk for FZRA early Tue AM, as the precip shield would not arrive until temps have risen above 32F. With H92 temps increasing to +5C to +7C, most locations should reach into the mid 50s in spite of the increasing cloud cover. A slow moving front, becoming parallel to the cyclonic flow W will slowly move across the region Wed into early Thu. Am noting a couple of weak vort-maxes which will translate to frontal waves, the first is within an airmass fully above 0C in the low levels, which coincident with PWATs near 1.25 inches or 2 std deviations above normal, support widespread rainfall. The latter wave, as the front begins to shift E of the region late Wed into Thu is the one worth watching, particularly the mesoscale thermal features. While moist warm conveyor and LLJ suggest the continuation of precipitation, whether or not deep layer air below 0C can undercut the warm conveyor enough to introduce some mixed frozen precipitation. There is far too many players and potential outcomes to suggest any one solution is best, as these are going to be very small-scale features in play. However, the possibility for some frozen precip before it ends early Thu.  Late week into the weekend... Although cooler air will begin settling to the E with the front shifting offshore, there are two issues to watch. The airmass, although cool is moderated by mainly bare ground as mentioned previously, and the deep cold dome remains W. Therefore, although below normal, temps should only be slightly cooler. The other, is how close the front hangs offshore, as there are still impulses which could trigger an ocean wave toward the weekend, with once again a potential for mixed precipitation.

Turning colder late week into the following weekend, slightly below seasonable. A pile-up across the N Atlantic early week the upstream pattern buckles and becomes amplified by late week. A H5 ridge-trof pattern across N America both energy and Arctic air become displaced S across E Canada/CONUS within the mean H5 trof with no where else to go. Two things worth noting.  1.) Magnitude of Arctic air. Prefer to see the stratospheric low over our half of the N Hemisphere to which is forecast to evolve across the E half of the N Hemisphere (thinking back to February of 2015). A lot of warm air surging towards the N pole plus considering forecast anomalies and the mostly bare ground S of the Canadian border, likely this is going to be a record breaking Arctic airmass and such an airmass is likely to moderate prior to reaching S New England. Thus leaning with 2m temperatures that are slightly below seasonable.  2.) Amplitude / sharpness of H5 trof. Whether flat or exhibiting a high level of curvature within the height contours, attention is deserved on mid-level disturbances rotating through the flow, as to whether there are sub-tropical connections coincident with strong jet dynamics subsequent of thermal wind response aided by H5 trof amplification / curvature over regions of greater baroclinicity. All of which aiding in potential storm development. However, with the magnitude of Arctic air subdued as was noted above, with a nod to warmer than average waters just off our shore, and some indications that the H5 ridge-trof pattern breaks briefly allowing energy to escape before H5 ridge-trof pattern reloads, there is less certainty in specifics further out in time as there are a lot of moving parts.  Seasonable conditions Saturday night through Monday night beneath high pressure. Sharp cold front across the region Tuesday through Wednesday, slowed by the pile-up over the N Atlantic and the H5 pattern subsequently buckling. An anomalous surge of warmer air in advance, could see highs back up into the 60s. Cold air undercutting late Wednesday into Thursday, will have to monitor closely any mid- level disturbances generating ascent that can draw back moisture resulting in a change-over from rain to snow. Friday through the weekend, definitely within the colder air but to what magnitude? Not thinking a true Arctic blast but temperatures slightly below average for early December (average highs in the low 40s, lows around 30). Then it`s a focus on additional energy rotating through the H5 trof, to what depth / magnitude and whether it exhibits any negative tilt. Perhaps a consequence of an upstream wave break and / or the pile-up downstream shifting E of 60W, there are indications within ensemble mean guidance that energy sweeping through could be quick moving before being allowed to deepen significantly as there`s opportunity to escape downstream. That`s not to say wintry weather is out of the question but rather could be quicker (skirting by) and wetter (by way of wet snow).  Still too early to say on the details towards mid-Dec. Operational forecast guidance not succinct with respect to the midweek cold frontal passage. Considerable spread in ensemble members with time as well as low ensemble probabilities for even 1-inch of snow (take a look at GEFS plumes as well). Await further forecast guidance as we get closer in time. Will hit upon any forecast considerations along with threats and impacts in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Saturday night through Monday night...  High pressure. Seasonable conditions. Highs in the 40s, lows in the 30s. Some faster N winds possible Sunday night into Monday with a deepening storm center well offshore, some implications with respect to coastal flooding as tides will be astronomically high. Otherwise winds light, shifting S into Tuesday morning ahead of an approaching cold front. See the TIDES/COASTAL FLOODING section below for more details on potential impacts along the shores.  Tuesday through Wednesday...  Cold front sweeping the region, slowing up as it does so before the main mid-level vortmax sweeps through. Couple of things to watch for:  1.) Warm air advection (WAA) in advance brought about by strong SW flow. How mild will it get? How effectively can low-level winds mix down to the surface? Leaning highs into the 60s as the magnitude of WAA limits potential mixing to the surface. Stout pressure gradient, WIND ADVISORY headlines may be needed along the S/SE coast simply for sustained winds in excess of 30 mph. Low confidence presently.  Also the question of how quickly it can scour out colder air left over from the departing high? With onset Tuesday morning along the nose of leading warm air and attendant warm frontal boundary lifting N along which isentropic upslope prevails, can`t rule out possible freezing rain within shallow, sheltered valleys of N/W MA. Something we`ll have to watch with respect to headlines.  2.) Precipitation change-over on the backside. With a follow-up mid- level vortmax and ascent, there`s the possibility of moisture draw back of the anti-cyclonic warm-moist conveyor belt along the 290- 300K isentropic surfaces netting precipitation overhang over the undercutting colder air. Could see the potential for rain changing over to snow albeit liquid precipitation amounts are likely to be light given the lack of both deep forcing and deeper moisture (the undercutting airmass likely to be drier closer to the surface).  Likely PoPs with anticipated widespread rain with embedded heavier showers. Initially light, chance of freezing rain over N/W MA for early Tuesday morning. Thereafter, decent theta-E plume of sub- tropical moisture through a deep column pushes across the region. Thinking heaviest rain late Tuesday into Wednesday morning, the potential for some weak instability to sneak N, can`t rule out the rumble of thunder along the S-coast. Anomalous as precipitable waters edge above 1.25 inches, around +2 standard deviations, with freezing level heights up around 9 kft agl. Late Wednesday into Thursday, the cold front pushing offshore, colder air under-cutting, going with slight chance to chance PoPs on the change-over to snow, holding accumulations to occur at 32 or lower, could see impacts over N/W MA, especially the high terrain.

Based on these observations and the west-to-east movement of the features, we expect a few leftover showers to give way to a wind shift first thing this morning, with clearing from west to east during the morning hours.  Northwest wind behind the cold front will be with us through the day. Temperatures below 850 mb don`t change much today. The supporting upper shortwave and its cold pool will be in place overhead during the morning and early afternoon. So expect some mixing, with model data suggesting a mixed layer to around 925 mb. Temperatures at that level will be about 0 to +2C, which should support max temps in the mid 40s to lower 50s.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - Seasonable and quiet Saturday night through Monday night  - Sweeping cold front Tuesday through Wednesday  - In advance, rain with embedded heavier showers, mild  - Rearward, rain changing to snow, possible light accumulations  - Slightly unseasonable, colder air around Friday into the weekend  - Simultaneously, watching for potential storm development  */ Overview...  Turning colder late week into the following weekend, slightly below seasonable. A pile-up across the N Atlantic early week the upstream pattern buckles and becomes amplified by late week. A H5 ridge-trof pattern across N America both energy and Arctic air become displaced S across E Canada/CONUS within the mean H5 trof with no where else to go. Two things worth noting.  1.) Magnitude of Arctic air. Prefer to see the stratospheric low over our half of the N Hemisphere to which is forecast to evolve across the E half of the N Hemisphere (thinking back to February of 2015). A lot of warm air surging towards the N pole plus considering forecast anomalies and the mostly bare ground S of the Canadian border, likely this is going to be a record breaking Arctic airmass and such an airmass is likely to moderate prior to reaching S New England. Thus leaning with 2m temperatures that are slightly below seasonable.  2.) Amplitude / sharpness of H5 trof. Whether flat or exhibiting a high level of curvature within the height contours, attention is deserved on mid-level disturbances rotating through the flow, as to whether there are sub-tropical connections coincident with strong jet dynamics subsequent of thermal wind response aided by H5 trof amplification / curvature over regions of greater baroclinicity. All of which aiding in potential storm development. However, with the magnitude of Arctic air subdued as was noted above, with a nod to warmer than average waters just off our shore, and some indications that the H5 ridge-trof pattern breaks briefly allowing energy to escape before H5 ridge-trof pattern reloads, there is less certainty in specifics further out in time as there are a lot of moving parts.  Seasonable conditions Saturday night through Monday night beneath high pressure. Sharp cold front across the region Tuesday through Wednesday, slowed by the pile-up over the N Atlantic and the H5 pattern subsequently buckling. An anomalous surge of warmer air in advance, could see highs back up into the 60s. Cold air undercutting late Wednesday into Thursday, will have to monitor closely any mid- level disturbances generating ascent that can draw back moisture resulting in a change-over from rain to snow. Friday through the weekend, definitely within the colder air but to what magnitude? Not thinking a true Arctic blast but temperatures slightly below average for early December (average highs in the low 40s, lows around 30). Then it`s a focus on additional energy rotating through the H5 trof, to what depth / magnitude and whether it exhibits any negative tilt. Perhaps a consequence of an upstream wave break and / or the pile-up downstream shifting E of 60W, there are indications within ensemble mean guidance that energy sweeping through could be quick moving before being allowed to deepen significantly as there`s opportunity to escape downstream. That`s not to say wintry weather is out of the question but rather could be quicker (skirting by) and wetter (by way of wet snow).  Still too early to say on the details towards mid-Dec. Operational forecast guidance not succinct with respect to the midweek cold frontal passage. Considerable spread in ensemble members with time as well as low ensemble probabilities for even 1-inch of snow (take a look at GEFS plumes as well). Await further forecast guidance as we get closer in time. Will hit upon any forecast considerations along with threats and impacts in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Sunday-Tuesday monitoring high astro tides and N winds  - Warm up Tuesday and Wednesday prior to a sweeping cold front  - Widespread rain, embedded heavier showers along the cold front  - Arctic air settling in during late week into the following weekend  Overview and model preferences... Although flat/zonal, S stream dominated flow remains in place through at least the mid term, the wave moving across the NE Sun looks to undercut sharp mid-Atlantic ridging. As previous forecaster noted, this forces the ridge to retrograde somewhat, digging a trof S of Greenland and forming a secondary rex block across the W Atlantic S of the Maritimes. Also noted previously, as Pacific ridging builds in response to deep warm feed. This shift from very progressive to blocked, amplified flow will define the pattern shift we have been monitoring for several runs now. The blocking will force digging arctic air into the Great Lakes and OH valley regions through mid-late week. How quickly this begins to impact the NE CONUS is still a somewhat uncertain forecast. Although, the amplification would imply a slower solutions, 30.12Z guidance has actually switched roles, with ECMWF now more progressive than the GFS. Ensembles are still widely spread. Given this, through the mid term, before the full switch, will continue with a consensus blend of guidance. However, will add more weight to ensemble means to encapsulate several possible solutions mid-late week.  Details...  Sat and Sat night... Core of +1025hPa slides over the region Sat. H92 temps will be most representative as subsidence will mitigate mixing. Temps at this level are between 0C and -1C. Which favor highs mid- upper 40s, or near seasonable. Increasing moisture late night combined with slight warming will limit min temps to the upper 20s to mid 30s. Overall, dry conditions prevail.  Sun and Mon... Weak and open wave will cross the region late Sun along with a very weak cold front. Column does moisten a bit, but PWATs remain seasonably dry with this passage. Cannot rule out a SHRA/SHSN in the higher terrain late Sun where upslope is enhanced, but most locations are likely to remain dry with this wave passage. Strong ridging begins into Mon along with S stream warming. The cold air is short lived, as H92 temps are already progged to be above 0C by 00Z Mon, then near +1C by Mon (column is isothermal in the low lvls as H85 temps are near the same). The ridging implies mainly dry wx with a gradual warming trend, yielding seasonably warm temps by Mon. Highs in the upper 40s and low 50s are expected while lows generally remain in the upper 20s and low 40s.  Tue thru Thu... As longwave trof continues to deepen and dig in the W, gradually occluding low pres sub 1000hPa will shift into N QC province. This is the first in a series of vort-maxes rotating through the cyclonic flow developing upstream of the ridge as it gradually shifts to S of the Maritimes. It appears, as models gradually converge, that there is an initial warm frontal shift N with this first wave on Tue. As PWATs increase with return flow to near 1.00 inches, cannot rule out a few SHRA for Tue. With H92 temps warming to +6C or even warmer, suggesting highs in the 50s and even the possibility of a few 60s under perfect conditions. Then, as the front settles E and over S New England, a secondary frontal wave will have to be watched. Again, timing is still uncertain here, but there is a focus on late Wed into Thu. Although ensembles are still spread, there is agreement on a deep theta-e plume along with PWATs nearing 1.3 inches, which is nearly 2 std deviations above normal, as well as K-indices near 35. This moisture is coincident with strong 40 kt S LLJ, so there is sufficient lift as the pattern transition occurs mid week, with widespread precipitation expected. Whether or not there is a mix of wintry precip will depend on how efficiently low lvl cold air/dry slot filter in following the actually. This will need to be watched as we approach, as it could be a mesoscale event. Wed, warming should allow highs to fall in the 50s to near 60 across much of the region, mild for early Dec before the deeper cold arrives by late week.  Late next week, when the colder air begins to settle in, will need to monitor how far offshore a front stalls for any frontal waves to develop.",

Increasing moisture late night combined with slight warming will limit min temps to the upper 20s to mid 30s. Overall, dry conditions prevail.  Sun and Mon... Weak and open wave will cross the region late Sun along with a very weak cold front. Column does moisten a bit, but PWATs remain seasonably dry with this passage. Cannot rule out a SHRA/SHSN in the higher terrain late Sun where upslope is enhanced, but most locations are likely to remain dry with this wave passage. Strong ridging begins into Mon along with S stream warming. The cold air is short lived, as H92 temps are already progged to be above 0C by 00Z Mon, then near +1C by Mon (column is isothermal in the low lvls as H85 temps are near the same). The ridging implies mainly dry wx with a gradual warming trend, yielding seasonably warm temps by Mon. Highs in the upper 40s and low 50s are expected while lows generally remain in the upper 20s and low 40s.  Tue thru Thu... As longwave trof continues to deepen and dig in the W, gradually occluding low pres sub 1000hPa will shift into N QC province. This is the first in a series of vort-maxes rotating through the cyclonic flow developing upstream of the ridge as it gradually shifts to S of the Maritimes. It appears, as models gradually converge, that there is an initial warm frontal shift N with this first wave on Tue. As PWATs increase with return flow to near 1.00 inches, cannot rule out a few SHRA for Tue. With H92 temps warming to +6C or even warmer, suggesting highs in the 50s and even the possibility of a few 60s under perfect conditions. Then, as the front settles E and over S New England, a secondary frontal wave will have to be watched. Again, timing is still uncertain here, but there is a focus on late Wed into Thu. Although ensembles are still spread, there is agreement on a deep theta-e plume along with PWATs nearing 1.3 inches, which is nearly 2 std deviations above normal, as well as K-indices near 35. This moisture is coincident with strong 40 kt S LLJ, so there is sufficient lift as the pattern transition occurs mid week, with widespread precipitation expected. Whether or not there is a mix of wintry precip will depend on how efficiently low lvl cold air/dry slot filter in following the actually. This will need to be watched as we approach, as it could be a mesoscale event. Wed, warming should allow highs to fall in the 50s to near 60 across much of the region, mild for early Dec before the deeper cold arrives by late week.  Late next week, when the colder air begins to settle in, will need to monitor how far offshore a front stalls for any frontal waves to develop.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Around Sunday / Monday monitoring high astro tides and N winds  - Potential nearby inverted \"NORLUN\" trof Sunday night into Monday  - Warm up Tuesday and Wednesday prior to a sweeping cold front  - Widespread rain, embedded heavier showers along the cold front  - Arctic air settling in during late week into the following weekend  */ Overview...  Winter is coming. Step back to the present, deep exchange ongoing over the N Atlantic and W Europe. Highly amplified, a wall is in place. Nothing abating upstream, the Pacific jet continues to pump mid-level energy across the CONUS through the zonal flow. Bottling up, one after another, across the Central N Atlantic, the blocking wall retrogrades from 30W to 60W longitude over the weekend into early next week. Slowed to stopped flow upstream, no where to go, the pattern amplifies, energy becomes displaced around the N pole, especially as mid-level disturbances jam up across E Canada. S draw of Arctic air magnified via S shear courtesy of amplified H5 ridging over Western N America, aided perhaps via MJO contributions, looking at H85 temperature anomalies on the order of -10 to -12C towards the end of the week around the Midwest (actual values aloft around -10 to -15C). Much of the region mid to late week, including our neck of the woods, will see unseasonably cold 2m temperatures. The jam up over E Canada, going into the following weekend, attention will be needed upon additional mid-level disturbances as they rotate through the amplified ridge-trof flow spread across the CONUS. Looking for sub-tropical connections coincident with strong dynamics and robust curvature associated with any trof amplification across regions of baroclinicity that`ll aid in storm development, this as Arctic air continues to spill S rearward, especially over the N Central CONUS.  The first half of the long-term forecast period beginning Friday night is mundane with the only concern being the proximity of the jam up across the NW Atlantic and the influence of N winds as we observe a period of high astronomical tides. With the continued zonal flow into midweek, looking at an ebb and flow pattern of near seasonable conditions followed by abnormal warmth prior to a sharp cold front sweeping the region Wednesday.  It`s behind the cold front that undoubtedly the NE CONUS finds itself on the cold and dry side of the envelope towards late week with a potential brush of winter-weather outcomes well N/W as low pressure develops and deepens over E Canada. Bottled up, we must watch for additional energy rotating through the amplified pattern, if there are any storm implications for our region. However, in evaluating mean ensemble guidance, it`s possible the plug is pulled across the N Atlantic allowing zonal \"escape\" flow E by the weekend, the downstream wall potentially having broken open.  Not sold on the late period 30.0z EC just yet. Considerable spread in ensemble guidance and a lot of moving parts that are 6 to 10 days out, low confidence in the forecast further out in time. Will hit upon any forecast considerations along with threats and impacts in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Saturday night through Monday night...  Jam up across the N Atlantic, monitoring northerly winds round deepening storm development E, well offshore, potential impacts upon N-facing shores during a period of high astro tides. This as additional mid-level energy sweeps the region which could lead to an inverted \"NORLUN\" trof Sunday into early Monday NE of our region across coastal Maine (push of colder air aloft, steeper lapse rates possibly on up to H7, in a region of mid-level ascent and height falls bringing about low-level convergent focus potential). Local enhancement to the N wind profile as high tides for Boston are forecast around 12.0 to 12.3 feet, for N facing shores there`s the threat of minor coastal flooding, especially along vulnerable shoreline roads. See the COASTAL FLOODING section below. Near to slightly below seasonable conditions throughout.  Tuesday into Wednesday...  Sweeping cold front. Period of widespread rain with embedded heavier showers given decent sub-tropical connection of higher theta-E under- going convergent forcing along the cold front and nose of low-level winds. Speaking of and considering strong warm air advection aloft, need to monitor the Tuesday night into early Wednesday time-frame for the possibility of strong SW winds, especially over SE New England. Early to say right now as to if headlines will be needed. Consistent signal within all model guidance of a stout SW jet at H925 up around 50 to 55 mph mainly over far SE New England. Aside, looking at the last gasp of warm temperatures before winter ushers in. Highs potentially topping out above 60 over SE New England on Wednesday just prior to cold frontal passage. The 30.0z GFS is still slightly faster to the 30.0z EC, the 30.0z Canadian in-between. Will lean on the 30.0z EC with this run. Echoing the previous forecaster but perhaps too early to say is whether quickly undercutting colder air will lend to some changing precipitation types towards snow on the backside of the sweeping cold front prior to the dry slot wrapping in and everything exiting out.  Wednesday night onward...  On the cold, dry side of the envelope. Leaning towards the 30.0z EC with the dry slot wrapping around the deepening low center jammed up across E Canada with no where to go. NW flow rearward, cross-polar implications with Arctic air spilling S, lake effect snow machine ongoing, could see some snow shower activity stream as far S/E as the Berkshires.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Mainly high pressure thereafter through Monday  - Monitoring high astronomical tides  - Pattern shift towards mid-December, possible Arctic air  Overview and model preferences... Flat/zonal flow continues through much of the long term as arctic remains strung-out N of Hudson Bay between strong ridging E of Greenland and MJO fed ridging near the W CONUS. Even though the last couple of runs of the ECMWF are more amplified than most other guidance with a shortwave late weekend, the progressive pattern favors offshore deepening, so will continue with this trend. Beyond this, there remains suggestions of a full pattern shift as S stream wave is able to phase with the arctic vortex, leading to deepening and digging longwave trof upstream of New England. Guidance diverges strongly by mid week with this deepening, ECMWF shows typical amplified bias while GFS retains its usual more progressive bias. However, the slower ECMWF solution does have some support from both CMC and several GEFS/EC ensemble members. Therefore, although with somewhat low confidence, will lean most heavily on its solution after early week ridging. For the mid term period, a consensus blend of guidance will still cover most possibilities within the envelope.  Details...  Fri into Sat night... Following cold frontal passage early Fri, cool and blustery NW flow develops in the CAA regime ahead of a nearly 1030hPa high pres. Rapid clearing as the sounding dries with 20-25 mph wind gusts as deep layer mixing develops. H85 temps drop to about -2C by 00Z Saturday, but this is the core of the coldest weather as mid lvl warming occurs thereafter given S stream dominant zonal flow. High pres maintains the dry conditions into Sat night. Highs are seasonable, mainly in the mid and upper 40s while lows drop into the 20s and low 30s within the core of the high pres.  Sun... Open shortwave (even the more acute ECMWF now keeps the wave open) moves across the region, yielding cyclogenesis well E of Georges Bank thanks to the progressive nature of the system. Although low lvl convergence/destabilization support the development of an inverted trof or Norlun, this too is too far east for major impact. At most, especially if wave/front is as robust as ECMWF suggests, a few SHSN/SHRA possible for the higher terrain where lift is aided by upslope. However, these will be few and far between and very light. Gradual increase in N-NW flow expected late Sun and Sun night in response to isallobaric component enhanced by offshore deepening low pres. This may allow for some ocean effect development as SST delta-T values approach 10-12C. Highs remain seasonably warm, mainly in the upper 40s to near 50.  Mon... High pres dominates within a gradually building ridge across the NE, a response to the pattern shift upstream discussed above. Dry wx prevails but with continued seasonably mild temperatures with highs upper 40s and low 50s.  Tue and Wed... As mentioned above, solutions diverge toward the middle part of the week as a gradual pattern transition occurs. Ridging continues to build across the E coast ahead of a longwave deepening in the OH valley and Great Lakes, with strong links to arctic and even cross-polar air. The building ridge does suggest continued warming ahead of the strong and gradually occluding low pres which is the sfc response to the upstream trof. If there is one sensible wx detail in which confidence can remain high, it is in the warming response to this ridging and E-CONUS wide WAA regime. In fact, before the colder air is allowed to filter in, H92 temps could reach as high as +8C to +10C per several ensemble/deterministic models. Therefore, will be leaning most heavily on warmer raw 2M temps for at least Tue. The question is, how long will it last, the GFS as mentioned above is much faster, while the ECMWF leads the camp of slower guidance. Given there is more agreement with this latter solution, will hold the warmer air in through Wed, with a transitional precip event possible Wed into Thu or longer depending on parallel flow. Will need to watch this closely, as thermal profiles within a transitional precip event change based on mesoscale factors and could include some wintry precip.

Given temps here already in the mid to upper 50s have increased highs into the low 60s this afternoon across RI and southeast MA. Record highs here are in the mid 60s, so should be safe but worth watching.  Mid band of clouds along with a few sprinkles across eastern CT/RI and eastern MA will continue to move east and give way to increasing sunshine this afternoon. Elsewhere, sunshine this morning will give way to sct-bkn post frontal strato-cu this afternoon with the frontal passage.  Frontal passage around midday western MA/CT and finally exiting eastern MA about 4 pm or so. Temps begin to fall with the frontal passage and wind shift from WSW to WNW.  Gusty prefrontal WSW winds 20-30 kt will become WNW 20-30 kt behind the front. Could have a few post frontal gusts up to 35 kt, which may result in a few isolated down branches/small limbs.  Previous discussion...  Cold front over the Great Lakes is moving east. Timing of the cloud band with this front, based on satellite imagery, brings clouds into Southern New England roughly 10Z west to 14Z east, with clouds departing roughly 15Z west to 19Z east. Jet dynamics look favorable, but moisture cross sections show a limited moist profile that is entirely below 700 mb. This is not impressive for any showers. We will show slight chance pops mainly north of the Mass Pike.  Southwest winds lead the cold front, and northwest winds occur behind the front. Overnight observations upstream show gusts 25-30 knots (30 to 35 mph) in the southwest flow and gusts to 30-33 knots (35 close to 40 mph) in the west-northwest flow. Forecast charts from 950 mb/2000 feet show a departing 50-knot (55-60 mph) southwest jet moving east of Mass at sunrise. Warm temps at the surface and cold advection aloft then bring deep mixing with 30-35 knots (35 to 40 mph) forecast in the layer, just shy of wind advisory criteria. Can`t rule out some isolated wind damage and have highlighted this in the hazardous weather outlook.  Even with the cold advection and a mixed layer to about 875 mb, temps remain warm enough...from +1C southeast to -4C northwest... to support max temps in the 50s and possibly touching 60 in parts of RI and southeast Mass.",

Subsequent ridging, Arctic air is dislodged and sheared southward towards Central and E N America, hence -EPO/+PNA trends, along with Pacific energy being cut-off over the SW CONUS from the mid-latitude flow.  Meanwhile over the N Atlantic, a bit more complicated. Persistent warm-moist pump towards the poles across the Davis Straight and Greenland lends to blocking mechanisms that make E/SE Canada a favorable region for storm development at times. However, the associated polar low wobbles back N/W, retrograding as it reloads, at which time additional Pacific energy through the mid-latitudes becomes cut-off into the N Central Atlantic by upstream ridging, gumming up the downstream zonal flow, hence a persistent -AO trend and an inconsistent NAO trend.  A distinct measure of uncertainty as ensemble means point towards a broad W to E ridge-trof pattern across the CONUS, yet however what is unclear are both the upstream and downstream forces which would influence the region most favorable for storm development, if any, and if such, on what side of the envelope do we reside? Also to keep in mind is how long it would last. We`re talking a forecast that is out roughly 10 days that has a lot of moving parts. Lots of unknowns at this time synoptically.  For now a zonal W to E flow as echoed by the +WPO/+EPO pattern will lock the Arctic cold to the N. S stream dominance of warmer air and higher heights across the region which lend towards energy becoming cut-off further downstream over the Atlantic into next week.

Cold frontal passage around Friday morning with a line of showers. It`s along and ahead within the warm air advection that S-stream energy may collide with precipitable waters up around 0.75 inches invoking an intrusion of low to mid level deformation over SE New England up against the cold front.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Nuisance weather, ebb and flow pattern into the end of the week  - Watching an offshore storm, high astro-tides into early next week  - Potential cooler pattern setting up into mid-December  Overview and model preferences... As noted by previous forecaster, relatively flat/zonal flow remains in place across the CONUS at least through early next week in spite of very sharp blocking wedged between Greenland and Iceland, which is too far east to impact much of the east coast. The profile is suggests S stream dominance. While there is indication of a pattern shift toward the middle of next week, as a cross polar arctic surge phases to force the mean vortex further S, there remains too many poorly sampled players. Focusing on the mid period, the first in a series of weak shortwaves pushes through quickly Thu night into Fri associated with a cold front. Synoptic pattern is generally well agreed upon with this particular feature, and the brief cool-down to follow. The second and likely stronger wave arrives by Sun-Mon. Initially ECMWF and some EC ensemble members were much more amplified and slower, suggesting coastal cyclogenesis occurs near shore, however, recent runs are more progressive, suggesting the deepening occurs too far to the E, which agrees with GFS and CMC as well as several ensemble members from both models. Will adjust toward this thinking. Given the better agreement with the 28.12Z guidance, will use a consensus blend for this forecast update.  Details...  Thu... +1025hPa high pres crests then shifts E Thu allowing for the development of weak return flow by late afternoon/evening. Increase in PWATs as a result to near 0.7 inches by 00Z Fri. High clouds spill over late, otherwise a mainly sunny start. Although H85 temps warm to nearly +2C by late day, subsidence will limit mixing to near H92, where temps rest near or just below 0C. Therefore, seasonably cool highs in the mid 40s are expected.  Thu night into Fri... Weak open wave will move across the region early Fri, allowing a low pres in QC to drag a reasonably robust cold front through the region. PWAT increase to near 0.7inches is close to 1 std deviation above seasonal normals, so combined with the low-mid lvl f-gen increase should see a round of mainly SHRA (BL temps look too warm across the board given an overnight dwpt increase) move through during the morning hours Fri. QPF plumes and ensemble probabilities support mainly 0.1-0.25 inches of liquid, which is reasonable given the open wave and rather progressive shift. Afternoon drier cold advection should allow for some late day clearing, but given the initial warming highs Fri should still exceed seasonable normals, mainly in the upper 40s and low 50s.  Sat... Second +1025hPa high pres crests Sat within weak ridging underneath the zonal jet aloft. H85 temps respond quickly following the brief cool down, and are isothermal between this and H92 (near 0C to +1C). Highs should reach seasonably warm values, mainly mid-upper 40s under mostly sunny skies. Overnight mins in the 20s and 30s.  Sun and Mon... A mentioned earlier, deepening low pres looks to occur offshore under the mainly progressive pattern. While this means the bulk of impacts associated with this second wave are offshore, a modest theta-e plume along with lift provided by the wave itself does suggest a risk for spot SHRA across the area (localized SHSN not ruled out, but sfc-H92 layer is generally near or even above 0C), but with little other precipitation expected outside of the Cape/Nantucket late Sun into Mon. This is thanks to SST-H85 delta-T values near 10-15C under N-NW flow between the building high to the W and deepening offshore coastal low. Ocean effect SHRA possible deepening on the final wind trajectory. Otherwise, near seasonable temps as the wave is progressive and allows low-mid lvl warming quickly following its passage.  Early next week... Warming initially as pattern shift supports the possibility of deepening vortex to the W mid-late week. This could yield another cold blast, but will have to see how the cross-polar flow develops before nailing anything down. One feature to watch early next week will be the high astronomical tides, see below for more information on this risk.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... */ Highlights...   - Nuisance weather, ebb and flow pattern into the end of the week  - Watching an offshore storm, high astro-tides into early next week  - Potential cooler pattern setting up into mid-December  Overview and model preferences... As noted by previous forecaster, relatively flat/zonal flow remains in place across the CONUS at least through early next week in spite of very sharp blocking wedged between Greenland and Iceland, which is too far east to impact much of the east coast. The profile is suggests S stream dominance. While there is indication of a pattern shift toward the middle of next week, as a cross polar arctic surge phases to force the mean vortex further S, there remains too many poorly sampled players. Focusing on the mid period, the first in a series of weak shortwaves pushes through quickly Thu night into Fri associated with a cold front. Synoptic pattern is generally well agreed upon with this particular feature, and the brief cool-down to follow. The second and likely stronger wave arrives by Sun-Mon. Initially ECMWF and some EC ensemble members were much more amplified and slower, suggesting coastal cyclogenesis occurs near shore, however, recent runs are more progressive, suggesting the deepening occurs too far to the E, which agrees with GFS and CMC as well as several ensemble members from both models. Will adjust toward this thinking. Given the better agreement with the 28.12Z guidance, will use a consensus blend for this forecast update.  Details...  Thu... +1025hPa high pres crests then shifts E Thu allowing for the development of weak return flow by late afternoon/evening. Increase in PWATs as a result to near 0.7 inches by 00Z Fri. High clouds spill over late, otherwise a mainly sunny start. Although H85 temps warm to nearly +2C by late day, subsidence will limit mixing to near H92, where temps rest near or just below 0C. Therefore, seasonably cool highs in the mid 40s are expected.  Thu night into Fri... Weak open wave will move across the region early Fri, allowing a low pres in QC to drag a reasonably robust cold front through the region. PWAT increase to near 0.7inches is close to 1 std deviation above seasonal normals, so combined with the low-mid lvl f-gen increase should see a round of mainly SHRA (BL temps look too warm across the board given an overnight dwpt increase) move through during the morning hours Fri. QPF plumes and ensemble probabilities support mainly 0.1-0.25 inches of liquid, which is reasonable given the open wave and rather progressive shift. Afternoon drier cold advection should allow for some late day clearing, but given the initial warming highs Fri should still exceed seasonable normals, mainly in the upper 40s and low 50s.  Sat... Second +1025hPa high pres crests Sat within weak ridging underneath the zonal jet aloft. H85 temps respond quickly following the brief cool down, and are isothermal between this and H92 (near 0C to +1C). Highs should reach seasonably warm values, mainly mid-upper 40s under mostly sunny skies. Overnight mins in the 20s and 30s.  Sun and Mon... A mentioned earlier, deepening low pres looks to occur offshore under the mainly progressive pattern. While this means the bulk of impacts associated with this second wave are offshore, a modest theta-e plume along with lift provided by the wave itself does suggest a risk for spot SHRA across the area (localized SHSN not ruled out, but sfc-H92 layer is generally near or even above 0C), but with little other precipitation expected outside of the Cape/Nantucket late Sun into Mon. This is thanks to SST-H85 delta-T values near 10-15C under N-NW flow between the building high to the W and deepening offshore coastal low. Ocean effect SHRA possible deepening on the final wind trajectory. Otherwise, near seasonable temps as the wave is progressive and allows low-mid lvl warming quickly following its passage.  Early next week... Warming initially as pattern shift supports the possibility of deepening vortex to the W mid-late week. This could yield another cold blast, but will have to see how the cross-polar flow develops before nailing anything down. One feature to watch early next week will be the high astronomical tides, see below for more information on this risk.",

This is courtsey of 1032 mb high over the region with deep layer mid level ridge just to the west of New England, providing anticyclonic flow and associated subsidence into our region. Winds will remain light this morning given High pres nearby but as this high moves offshore SSW winds will pickup this afternoon especially across the interior. Thus a bit of a wind chill factor this afternoon.  Chilly start to the day but temps will recover into the 40s especially with developing SSW winds streaming across water temps in the mid to upper 40s. Previous forecast captures this well so no major changes planned with this update.  Previous discussion...  High pressure starts the day over New England and the eastern USA coast, moving offshore by evening. This will bring plenty of subsidence, which means lots of sunshine and dry air through the day. The south-southwest flow will bring milder air north during the afternoon, but the colder air will linger near the surface and cap the mixed layer low in the column. We used 950 mb for our calculations...temps at that level by early afternoon will range from 2C in the west to -2C in the east with further warming later in the afternoon.

So temperatures will not fall much from evening levels and should even go up a few degrees overnight. Expect min temps in the mid 30s to 40s in the evening, climbing into/through the 40s overnight and possibly reaching the low 50s along the South Coast.  Wednesday...  A cold front moves through during midday and afternoon. Dynamic forcing over the front will be most favorable in Northern New England and marginal at best over Southern New England. Moisture will also be limited, mainly below 700 mb. Can`t rule out a few showers in the limited lift and moisture, but slight chance at best.  Southwest winds ahead of the cold front will swing from the northwest behind the cold front in the afternoon.

Potential pattern shift towards mid-December. Presently, S-stream dominance echoed by the +WPO/+EPO pattern. Uninhibited Pacific jet pumping milder air into the CONUS, perhaps aided by a forecast weak MJO transitioning through phases 4/5/6, yielding subsequent height rises, locking colder air N towards the pole. Periods of warm air N as seen via H85 temperature anomalies ahead of mid-latitude Pacific- origin disturbances, looking at near to slightly-above seasonable temperatures through the week, showery weather at times with cold frontal passages, parent lows well N/E up into Canada followed by highs emerging out of the CONUS rather than Canada, a progressive ebb and flow pattern with little in the way of threats and impacts.  However, a more amplified pattern is possible towards mid-December. Per ensemble means, -EPO/+PNA trend in response to a gradual shift in the Rossby wave train. The once H5 ridge over the N Pacific with troughing into the Gulf of AK, now lax, re-emerges however slightly downstream, E, with dominant H5 ridging into the Gulf of Alaska into Western N America shearing S cutoff lows into the SW CONUS. Pump of milder Pacific air shifts N into NW Canada through the upper levels on up into the stratosphere seemingly invoking a cross-polar flow aimed into Central and E Canada, S/E towards our neck of the woods. A potential deeper N stream trof against S stream energy out of the SW CONUS cutoff converges E out across the E CONUS going into mid- December? A block re-emerging up across the Davis Straight per ECens yet the 28.0z operational EC suggests of greater magnitude over the N Atlantic.  All this in mind, there`s still a lot of uncertainty that depends on synoptics. Given the discussion above, favor downstream cyclogenesis that`ll put the NE CONUS beneath a cooler, breezy N/W flow over the weekend into early next week. Thereafter, low confidence. Towards mid-December, if ECens means are foretelling, should the -EPO/+PNA trend maintain, then can`t rule out an open door of Arctic air over the NE CONUS, near to below seasonable conditions continuing, a nod to the CPC 3-4 week outlook. But as to anything further such as potential storm development, proximity, specifics, etc., remains unknown at this time (i.e., magnitude / proximity of potential N Atlantic block).

Now, for the past few runs, there is growing consensus that a cold front/trough will move swiftly across New England, with low pressure not really developing along the front until it is farther out to sea, well to our east. The piece of energy in question was located between 145W and 150W longitude out in the Pacific as of 4 PM. Only a couple of the GFS ensemble members have a distinct low pressure center close to the New England coast.  As a result, am forecasting a 50-60 percent probability of rain showers moving through Thursday night and exiting the coast early Friday morning. There is a very low probability that some mixed precipitation could occur in Franklin County, MA near the Vermont border at the start, but am not forecasting that at this time.  Friday afternoon through Monday...  Mainly dry weather is expected as high pressure attempts to build in from the west.

    "synopsis": ".SYNOPSIS... An upper level disturbance will bring some clouds and possibly a few flurries overnight. Dry high pressure builds in from the west Monday and becomes centered over southern New England late Monday night. Rather windy Monday then much colder with lighter winds Monday night. Milder temperatures return by mid week. Low pressure may develop near or south of the region late Thursday or Friday, which may bring some rainfall.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM MONDAY MORNING/...  1015 PM Update...  Lots of mid and high clouds over the region as seen on latest GOES-16 IR satellite imagery. This cloudiness associated with a very strong jet streak diving southeast from the Great Lakes with its LFQ of the upper jet over southern New England. This jet streak tied to secondary short wave trough over exiting Ontario and entering southwest Quebec.  Surface winds across southern New England beginning to back to the southwest ahead of this feature. So the combination of some cloud cover and modest WSW winds overnight will result in temps only falling to seasonable levels. Previous forecast captures these details nicely so no major changes with this forecast update. Earlier discussion below.  Previous Discussion...  Clouds will rapidly be on the increase ahead of a strong upper level disturbance. This vorticity max was just north of Lake Huron per water vapor satellite imagery at 3 PM. It will zip east-southeastward across northern and central New England around midnight and off the coast by 4 AM. It is associated with a 125 kt jet max at 300 mb.  Very dry air at the surface will likely evaporate any precipitation falling from mid clouds, but a few flurries may be in the air north of the Mass Pike from Worcester to Boston and northward to the NH border, within a couple hours either side of midnight. A few snow showers are possible in the E slopes of the Berkshires, especially in northwest Franklin County, MA through daybreak.  Lows overnight will range from 25 to 30 across the region.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM MONDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT/... Monday...Northwest flow persists behind departing short wave, leading to another round of gusty winds, to around 25 mph...not as strong as they were today. Highs will average a few degrees below normal, mainly 40 to 45, except upper 30s in the northwest MA hills and upper 40s in southern RI and on the southern MA coast.  Monday night...High pressure becomes centered over southern New England late at night. Skies will be clear and winds will become light, allowing temperatures to plummet. Have forecast lows a little below guidance values...in the upper teens in northwest MA and 20 to 25 elsewhere, except upper 20s to lower 30s Cape Cod and the islands.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...  Highlights...  * Temperatures will run close to or above normal through most   of this period * Mainly dry conditions through Thursday * Low pressure and a cold front will slowly cross the region   Thursday night into Friday  Overview...  12Z model suite continues to signal progressive northern stream storm track through at least Thursday. Even with the fast flow at the surface and aloft, continue to see very good consistency amongst the model suite as well as the ensembles.  Models and ensembles start to show widening solution spread as H5 short wave works out of the Rockies across the northern Plains in the Wed-Thu timeframe. By late this week, lower confidence due to differences in timing and track of this short wave, which yields a surface low forming somewhere near the Great Lakes. 12Z GFS appears to be a slow outlier with both the short wave and surface system, plus being further S with the system. The GGEM, ECMWF and even the UKMET a bit faster and somewhat weaker with the system. Leaned toward a non-GFS solution for this feature during the Thu night into Fri night timeframe.  Noting a bit more model solution spread over next weekend, but appears to be occurring E of the region, namely a possible ocean storm well E of New England as seen on the 12Z ECMWF run which may slow down progression of large high pressure extending from western Quebec to the Carolina coast late next weekend.  Temps will run near or above seasonal normals through the remainder of this week, with the mildest temps around Wednesday ahead of approaching cold front, then may fall to near normal levels next weekend.  Details...  Tuesday... High pressure at the surface and aloft moves across the region as H5 ridge also progresses E. N winds will back to SW during Tuesday afternoon. Daytime highs will be mainly in the lower-mid 40s, but temps may hold steady by sunset as milder air starts to work in.  Tuesday night-Wednesday... The high settles S of New England as a cold front slowly pushes E out of the Great Lakes. Expect a non-diurnal temps bottoming out in the upper 30s to mid 40s early then slowly rising mainly after midnight under mostly clear skies.  The cold front out of the Great Lakes pushes across the region around midday Wed. However, most of the energy and moisture remains N of the region, so expect a dry frontal passage. It will be a mild day with gusty SW winds mainly along the S coast through midday, then will shift to W-NW during the afternoon. Expect highs in the upper 40s across the higher terrain, ranging to the mid and upper 50s across the coastal plain.  Thursday... Another progressive high pressure moves across. N-NW winds will keep temps close to seasonal levels. Mostly sunny skies early, then clouds will increase during the afternoon.  Thursday night-Friday... Winds shift to S-SE as the high moves offshore. As mentioned above, model solution spread increases with the GFS the slowest outlier with developing low pressure and its movement across the Great Lakes. The remaining model suite keeps the H5 system open and progressive, but will still bring a period of showers possibly as early as Thu evening. Should see improving conditions later Friday as winds shift to W.  Friday night through Sunday... Lower confidence as models continue with rather wide solution spread during this timeframe.

Cold front is making steady progress eastward and will cross southern New England overnight. Not much in way of showers ahead of it so far but high-res guidance still insists on band of showers developing in SW flow across parts of RI and SE MA overnight. Another batch of showers was located behind front across upstate NY which is associated with upper trough, and this may bring some rain/snow showers to areas near Berkshires overnight.",

Large scale pattern over the CONUS features fairly progressive and nonconsolidated flow with air masses of a largely Pacific origin. The timing and strength of a short wave trough in the northern stream could have a significant bearing on Wednesday`s high temperature. Late in the week a vigorous short wave trough becomes separated from the rest of the northern stream and may set the stage for coastal cyclogenesis and the first chance in the forecast period of any significant precipitation over the area. The development of the east coast closed upper low may be indicative of the start of a trend for the hemispheric flow to exhibit higher amplitude and become more blocky after this forecast period. Will take a look at day to day developments with some focus late in the period when a coastal storm may provide more impactful weather.  Monday...NW flow in wake of secondary short wave trough in northern stream will keep 850 mb temperatures generally -6C to -9C during the afternoon and high temperatures in the lower to mid 40s. Any flurries over the higher terrain are expected to end Monday morning.  Tuesday...Warmer air returns as upper level heights build. Operational medium range models depict 850 mb temperatures rising to near or a little above 5C during the afternoon. Went a little higher than a straight model blend. Think we will see high temperatures near 50, if not in lower 50s, in many locations on Tuesday.  Wednesday...Upper shortwave trough in northern stream brings surface cold front through the region. The front looks to be dry with just some associated cloudiness. The low level cold air does not really filter into southern New England until at night and even then there is a possibility that the colder air gets hung up in northern New England as the front becomes parallel to the upper flow and by Thursday morning 500 mb heights may already be rising in advance of troughs in both the northern and southern streams progressing eastward across central North America. Wednesday may end up being quite mild with temperatures well into the 50s, and there is some uncertainty as to how low temperatures will get Wednesday night.  Thursday...Looks to be dry with surface ridge of high pressure extending into New England. There is some model spread in the thermal field and for now have stayed close with a model blend, which results in near normal temperatures for this time of year.  Friday and Saturday...This is when it gets a little more interesting. Looks like a rather robust shortwave trough with most of the energy separating from the rest of the northern stream to cause a split flow regime over eastern North America. One significant impact of this is to cut off the supply of cold air. Most Operational models and their ensembles seem to agree on the large scale picture of an amplifying trough that becomes negative tilt and even prone to closing off as it approaches the mid Atlantic coast. Diffluent flow aloft and at least some hint of a dual jet structure may set the region up for fairly significant precipitation. At this time, it looks as though most, if not all, of the precipitation will fall as rain in spite of a synoptically favored surface low position for snow in December. The short wave energy that initiates the east coast development appears as though it will probably be largely cut off from the rest of the northern stream flow and have an air mass origin from the Pacific. This system may become vertically very deep and shows signs of stalling over next weekend. This may act to cause a prolonged wet period as well as possibly eventually pull colder air into part of the region to create ptype issues. There remains very low confidence this far out on how all of this will evolve.  The late week/weekend system may produce a significant low level jet of 40 to 50 knots or so at 925 mb and a surface gradient tight enough to sustain gales. This could result in some coastal impacts next weekend as the astronomical high tides become quite high.

Shortwave pattern shows a shortwave moving through a zonal flow. One shortwave moves through New England Sunday, with lingering troffiness over the area on Monday. A ridge builds for Tuesday, then a more shallow shortwave races across on Wednesday. Another shortwave, this one a little deeper, reaches New England toward the end of next week.  Model mass fields are in general agreement east of the Rockies through Wednesday. Mass and thermal fields with a shortwave moving in off the Pacific Ocean show less agreement with that feature during most of the forecast period up through the time it reaches us the end of next week. Confidence in the forecast is strong through midweek, but low-moderate on next Friday.  Contour heights are lower/colder than normal Sunday and Monday, then trend above normal midweek, then trend lower/colder again by Friday.  Details...  Sunday-Monday...  Upper trough digs over New England Sunday. Cold pool will be in place with 500-mb temps at -30C, which will destabilize the airmass. Moisture lingers below 800 mb during this time. Expect quite a few clouds to pop during the day, possibly a few flurries in the north. Mixed layer temps will support max sfc temps in the upper 30s and 40s. Winds in the mixed layer reach 20-25 knots in the ECMWF and 30- 35 knots in the GFS. Either way, expect gusty northwest winds. We took a blend of the two.  The trough and cold pool move off on Monday and high pressure builds surface and aloft. Could be some lingering clouds Monday but should trend to less sky cover during the day. Expect a fair day with max sfc temps in the 40s.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Developing southwest flow brings milder air to the region Tuesday. Another cold front crosses New England Wednesday, but with most of the curvature and the core of the upper jet over VT/NH/ME. Expect a cold frontal passage during the day, with a few clouds and a wind shift, but otherwise dry.  High pressure builds with dry weather Thursday. Temperatures cool a little from Wednesday.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... Big Picture...  Longwave trough lingers over the Eastern USA much of the period, but with a flattening trend. Shortwave pattern shows a shortwave moving through a zonal flow. One shortwave moves through New England Sunday, with lingering troffiness over the area on Monday. A ridge builds for Tuesday, then a more shallow shortwave races across on Wednesday. Another shortwave, this one a little deeper, reaches New England toward the end of next week.  Model mass fields are in general agreement east of the Rockies through Wednesday. Mass and thermal fields with a shortwave moving in off the Pacific Ocean show less agreement with that feature during most of the forecast period up through the time it reaches us the end of next week. Confidence in the forecast is strong through midweek, but low-moderate on next Friday.  Contour heights are lower/colder than normal Sunday and Monday, then trend above normal midweek, then trend lower/colder again by Friday.  Details...  Sunday-Monday...  Upper trough digs over New England Sunday. Cold pool will be in place with 500-mb temps at -30C, which will destabilize the airmass. Moisture lingers below 800 mb during this time. Expect quite a few clouds to pop during the day, possibly a few flurries in the north. Mixed layer temps will support max sfc temps in the upper 30s and 40s. Winds in the mixed layer reach 20-25 knots in the ECMWF and 30- 35 knots in the GFS. Either way, expect gusty northwest winds. We took a blend of the two.  The trough and cold pool move off on Monday and high pressure builds surface and aloft. Could be some lingering clouds Monday but should trend to less sky cover during the day. Expect a fair day with max sfc temps in the 40s.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Developing southwest flow brings milder air to the region Tuesday. Another cold front crosses New England Wednesday, but with most of the curvature and the core of the upper jet over VT/NH/ME. Expect a cold frontal passage during the day, with a few clouds and a wind shift, but otherwise dry.  High pressure builds with dry weather Thursday. Temperatures cool a little from Wednesday.  Friday...  Cold front moves through during the day, but differences among the models upstream lead to uncertainty in the timing as well as the stability of this solution.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... Highlights...  * Scattered showers Saturday night and then mainly dry rest of the   forecast period * Blustery behind cold front on Sunday * Milder temperatures may be in store for Tuesday and Wednesday  Discussion...  Forecast area will be subject to a series of fairly low amplitude upper short wave trough passages for the next 7 days. At the surface, these will be reflected by mainly dry frontal passages. After Sunday and Monday, it looks to be mainly dry, but some uncertainty in temperatures due to uncertainty in whether the southern and northern stream flow is the more dominant over the region. As is typically the case in a pattern with progressive short wave troughs, there are uncertainties especially in the timing. However, the impact on the forecast is mitigated by the fact that there is limited moisture available. Most of the focus for this forecast period is early on with the cold front passage Saturday night followed by a rather blustery day on Sunday.  A fairly sharp upper short wave trough and moderately strong surface cold front affect the region Saturday night. Moisture is expected to be fairly limited given the trajectory of this feature, but bufkit soundings do show a brief period of fairly deep moisture especially closer to the coast where there is some marine influence in the lower levels. This looks to be enough to support at least scattered light showers.  Moderately strong cold air advection follows on Sunday with 850 mb temperatures +2C to +4C Saturday evening dropping to about -5C to - 8C by midday Sunday. Upper trough axis probably does not pass through southern New England until midday Sunday and so cannot rule out a few flurries at least across the higher terrain. The surface pressure gradient and cold air advection will likely produce mixing of 25 knots or slightly higher gusts to the surface during the day Sunday over land and perhaps closer to 30 knots over the water.  Medium range models suggest another upper short wave trough in the NW flow moving across New England Sunday night. This looks to be dry other than a chance of a few flurries over the east slopes of the Berkshires.  For Tuesday through Wednesday, 500 mb heights rise in response to a southern stream trough ejecting from the 4 corners area, and this should be reflected in milder temperatures. A fly in the ointment, however, could be a northern stream short wave trough that may hold back warm air advection in to New England. For now have gone with a model blend with a somewhat greater temperature gradient than average from north to south. Given uncertainty in timing and strength of this northern shortwave, there is below average confidence in mid week temperatures.  Operational and ensemble runs suggest upper level ridging over our area ahead of a somewhat more amplified trough moving across the Mississippi Valley on Thursday with possibly an approaching warm front late in the day or Thursday night.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/... 940 PM update...  Satellite data continues to indicate some high clouds moving across New England. Thus far, these clouds have not prevented temperatures from falling quickly this evening, especially under an area of clouds across RI and eastern MA. Clouds just moving into western MA appears to be slightly lower in height and thicker. These clouds should impact temperatures as they pass overhead.  No precipitation upstream. So the main adjustment was to tweak temperatures based on observed and expected trends. 24/01Z LAMP guidance looked to have the best handle, so used that as the basis for this forecast update.  Previous discussion...  Scattered to broken mid to high cloud decks filtering across the region could put a blanket on Thanksgiving festivities keeping temperatures slightly warmer. Positively- tilted open wave and attendant weak vortmax sweeps through the region early across the N-stream, a flattening feature, as energy sweeps up from the SE. Mid to high clouds sweeping through however into a region of drier air and subsidence, can already see some erosion in the latest GOES-16 satellite. Perhaps some blanket / insolation impacts so did not go with coldest of MOS guidance. Towards the lower end with forecast light winds, looking at lows down into the 20s, warmer along the shore.",

Warm air advection proceeding aloft, mixing is limited to around H95. Looking at highs in the upper 40s to low 50s, edging towards the warmer end of guidance.  With both N and S stream energy still neighboring our region, dry subsidence inversion prevails. As we go towards evening, the cap well in place, mixing up to just beneath, and the boundary layer cools, likely to see the moisture pooling condense and subsequently could see the development of low-level stratus evening and overnight especially over SE New England. Lows down into the 30s most places, but warmer SE around the low 40s. With daytime mixing, dewpoints should be low enough that 5 to 10 degree dewpoint depressions prevail. So despite the overnight N/W looking favorable for radiational cooling, do not expect fog to be an issue.",

Longwave scale shows a broad trough along the USA East Coast and West Atlantic, a second trough over the Eastern Pacific, and a ridge over the the Plains. The Eastern trough lingers much of the week while the overall flow trends zonal.  Model consensus shows northern stream shortwaves crossing New England Saturday night/Sunday and again Wednesday. The models also show a southern stream low crossing the Southeast USA Thursday trailing the Wednesday northern shortwave.  The mass and thermal fields are similar through Mon night/Tuesday, but then diverge by showing different timing of the northern and southern stream features. The feature that becomes the northern and southern shortwaves next week is currently over the Aleutians and diving south over the Pacific Ocean...and it reaches the USA West Coast by Monday. Expect changeable solutions regarding this feature until that time.  Contour heights and thermal fields are a little above normal Saturday, trend colder than normal Sunday-Monday, then trend above normal midweek next.  Details...  Saturday...  Low pressure passes well offshore. General agreement that the southern shortwave remains unphased with the northern trough. Meanwhile, the northern trough doesn`t dig much until the offshore low is moving past us. So expect the precipitation to remain over the ocean.  Cold front approaches during the afternoon and passes through Southern New England during the evening/early night. Moisture is limited below 700 mb much of the time, but runs deep briefly during the evening. Precipitable water values climb to about 0.85 inches during the evening, which is above normal for late November. We will show low-end chance pops during the late afternoon/evening.  Temps in the mixed layer are forecast at 850-mb equiv of -1C to -4C, so expect max sfc temps in the 50s.  Behind the front, the airmass cools and dries slowly, so min temps at night should only fall to the 30s and low 40s.  Sunday-Monday...  Upper trough digs over New England Sunday. Cold pool will be in place with 500-mb temps at -28C working to destabilize the airmass. Moisture lingers below 800 mb during this time.  Expect quite a few clouds to pop during the day, but moisture is too limited for showers. Mixed layer temps will support max sfc temps in the upper 30s and 40s.  The trough moves off on Monday and high pressure builds surface and aloft. Expect a fair day with max sfc temps in the 40s.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Another cold front crosses us midweek, driven by the northern stream shortwave. As noted above, there are timing uncertainties among the models, so we used a blend. This favors a Wednesday passage at this time, but the uncertainties noted above may change that exact timing. This will need to be monitored.  The blend of model data supports slight chance pops Wednesday with the cold fropa and mainly dry Thursday.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...  Scattered to broken mid to high cloud decks filtering across the region could put a blanket on Thanksgiving festivities keeping temperatures slightly warmer. Positively-tilted open wave and attendant weak vortmax sweeps through the region early across the N-stream, a flattening feature, as energy sweeps up from the SE. Mid to high clouds sweeping through however into a region of drier air and subsidence, can already see some erosion in the latest GOES-16 satellite. Perhaps some blanket / insolation impacts so did not go with coldest of MOS guidance. Towards the lower end with forecast light winds, looking at lows down into the 20s, warmer along the shore.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/...  Nice day on tap. With daytime mixing under mostly clear conditions, the mid to high clouds eroding out, winds turn S/SW. Warm air advection proceeding aloft, mixing is limited to around H95. Looking at highs in the upper 40s to low 50s, edging towards the warmer end of guidance.  With both N and S stream energy still neighboring our region, dry subsidence inversion prevails. As we go towards evening, the cap well in place, mixing up to just beneath, and the boundary layer cools, likely to see the moisture pooling condense and subsequently could see the development of low-level stratus evening and overnight especially over SE New England. Lows down into the 30s most places, but warmer SE around the low 40s. With daytime mixing, dewpoints should be low enough that 5 to 10 degree dewpoint depressions prevail. So despite the overnight N/W looking favorable for radiational cooling, do not expect fog to be an issue.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...  Big Picture...  Longwave scale shows a broad trough along the USA East Coast and West Atlantic, a second trough over the Eastern Pacific, and a ridge over the the Plains. The Eastern trough lingers much of the week while the overall flow trends zonal.  Model consensus shows northern stream shortwaves crossing New England Saturday night/Sunday and again Wednesday. The models also show a southern stream low crossing the Southeast USA Thursday trailing the Wednesday northern shortwave.  The mass and thermal fields are similar through Mon night/Tuesday, but then diverge by showing different timing of the northern and southern stream features. The feature that becomes the northern and southern shortwaves next week is currently over the Aleutians and diving south over the Pacific Ocean...and it reaches the USA West Coast by Monday. Expect changeable solutions regarding this feature until that time.  Contour heights and thermal fields are a little above normal Saturday, trend colder than normal Sunday-Monday, then trend above normal midweek next.  Details...  Saturday...  Low pressure passes well offshore. General agreement that the southern shortwave remains unphased with the northern trough. Meanwhile, the northern trough doesn`t dig much until the offshore low is moving past us. So expect the precipitation to remain over the ocean.  Cold front approaches during the afternoon and passes through Southern New England during the evening/early night. Moisture is limited below 700 mb much of the time, but runs deep briefly during the evening. Precipitable water values climb to about 0.85 inches during the evening, which is above normal for late November. We will show low-end chance pops during the late afternoon/evening.  Temps in the mixed layer are forecast at 850-mb equiv of -1C to -4C, so expect max sfc temps in the 50s.  Behind the front, the airmass cools and dries slowly, so min temps at night should only fall to the 30s and low 40s.  Sunday-Monday...  Upper trough digs over New England Sunday. Cold pool will be in place with 500-mb temps at -28C working to destabilize the airmass. Moisture lingers below 800 mb during this time.  Expect quite a few clouds to pop during the day, but moisture is too limited for showers. Mixed layer temps will support max sfc temps in the upper 30s and 40s.  The trough moves off on Monday and high pressure builds surface and aloft. Expect a fair day with max sfc temps in the 40s.  Tuesday through Thursday...  Another cold front crosses us midweek, driven by the northern stream shortwave. As noted above, there are timing uncertainties among the models, so we used a blend. This favors a Wednesday passage at this time, but the uncertainties noted above may change that exact timing. This will need to be monitored.  The blend of model data supports slight chance pops Wednesday with the cold fropa and mainly dry Thursday.",

Quiet weather Thursday and Friday. Another shot of wet weather and breezy conditions this weekend. Drier and milder toward the middle of next week.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/... 10am update... OBs and MSAS mass/thermal fields suggest cold front has moved into W MA/CT but remains somewhat dammed against the Berkshires/Litchfield hills. As the peak moisture plume across E MA/RI continues a slow shift to the E with attendant coastal low pres offshore, this should allow the front to begin to make a slow transition E. Initially, the added f-gen provided by the front should lead to a net increase in RA across W MA/CT so will actually feature rising POPs over the next few hours. However, thereafter as CAA/dry air begins to entrain through the column, this RA will end mid-day through the afternoon W-E across S New England. Will maintain a low risk for occasional TSRA as KDP/CC before the radar equipment issue showed good ice signatures aloft.  Have slowed the E progress of the higher POPs this afternoon as confluence of higher theta-e and phasing of the approaching front looks to generate a weak meso-low pres which will slow the drier air moving in. Still, most locations should see the end of rainfall by sunset.  Previous discussion...  Split flow across the region early this morning as northern stream cold front approaches from the Great Lakes. Southern stream shortwave/coastal low off the Carolina coast will move northward up the east coast. This system will remain well offshore but its moisture plume will impact the region.  Currently, surface cold front is making its way into upstate NY. Radar imagery shows some showers along this front, but overall moisture is pretty meager. Southern New England remains in the warm sector ahead of this approaching front thus temps early this morning have reside above average. In fact, the office is currently a balmy 51 degrees with Nantucket at 56F.  Focusing south, latest GOES-16 satellite shows moisture beginning to stream northwards towards New England thanks to Bermuda high pressure. Current radar imagery shows widespread showers across the Carolina coast, with scattered showers developing across Long Island and into southeast Massachusetts. These showers are associated with the upper level jet and mid- level moisture at 700mb. At the surface, theta-e gradient has set-up with a 1000-925mb frontogenesis which has help aided the showers in southern New England. The profile has moisten up as guidance suggested as rainfall is being reported from WST to EWB.  Over the next few hours, moisture will continue to stream into the region as surface cold front from the West approaches. This will help pool the moisture into the area and push PWAT values to above 1.0 inch by the mid-morning hours. Showers will begin to overspread the rest of the region after 7AM. The combination of the upper level jet and LLJ will help aid in strong lift for the region. In fact, guidance continues to hint at strong omega during the mid-morning hours especially along and points east of I-95. This combined with the high PWATs will lead to heavy downpours across RI and eastern MA. NCAR ensembles continue to show the potential for 40dbz during the 7Am to noon time-frame. Also cannot rule out a rumble or thunder as guidance continues to hint as SB Cape thanks to higher dewpoints.  Continued to trend QPF towards the EC but with the Hi-res guidance mix in as well. Appears that heavy precip axis will be along of just east of the I-95 corridor. This is also supported by the HREF, NCAR ensembles and HRRR. Generally 0.5 to 1 inch QPF will fall across a line east of IJD to BVY. Highest amounts will occur just east of I- 95. Areas west of the Worcester Hills will see rainfall amounts less than 0.25 inches.  As the front pushes through southern New England, precip will exit the region by the mid-afternoon. Behind the front, dry but cooler air will quickly usher into the region leading to temps dropping through the afternoon hours and winds beginning to pick up.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 3 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/...  1000 PM Update...  Overall trend in the forecast remains on track for this evening. High level clouds from southern stream system will continue to advect northward and thus will slow temperatures from radiating out. In fact, temperatures have remain above guidance at this hour and thus have trended the forecast with current observations.  Precipitation will take its time reaching southern New England overnight. 00z Upton NY sounding shows a lot of dry air in the mid to upper levels. Thus will wait until 700mb moisture streams into the region before the first raindrops fall. Bulk of the rain still remains across South Carolina but as approaching shortwave from the Great Lakes approaches and begins to go neg, precip should quickly stream up into New England.  Went ahead and adjusted forecast towards latest hi-res guidance and thus slowed precip timing til after 3AM.  Previous discussion...  Strong subsidence inversion in a regime of continually rising heights this afternoon, have led to mainly clear conditions outside of a few high cloud wisps. This has allowed BL mixing to push into the inversion a bit further aloft than previous guidance suggested, and led to some upper 50s and even low 60s for afternoon highs especially away from the coastline, and in the Merrimack valley where some downsloping is occurring.  The sounding is gradually moisture loading from the top down, but have noticed a recent gradual increase in surface dewpoints. The response is a layer of CI building N from offshore, which combined with the maintenance of a strong pres gradient should limit evening decoupling somewhat especially S of the Mass Pike. Mins will likely occur early in the overnight, before 3 AM once the lower column moistens. Strong temp gradient will result, with low 30s still possible across the N/NW where some decoupling is possible. Meanwhile, closer to the SE coastline temps are likely to remain in the upper 40s and low 50s, given an overall lack of setup for radiational cooling. Precip will hold off through 3 AM, see below for more information.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /3 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Early AM through Wednesday evening...  Acute upper lvl shortwave will slide E late tonight from the Great Lakes, deepening somewhat as it does so. Merging upper jet setup will allow for ocean cyclogenesis off the mid Atlantic S of the Carolinas after midnight in the equatorward entrance region of the S jet. Meanwhile N jet is associated with slow moving cold front attendant to low pres sliding through ON/QC early AM. All models except the ECMWF and many of its ensemble members were initially keeping each of these features as fully separate entities, even as coastal low pres develops an inverted trof which will impact S New England. 12Z guidance a bit more favorable for at least some phasing of these features, closer to the slower and more amplified ECMWF, which has been more persistent. This forecast update will lean most heavily on the ECMWF given its persistence with this features.  Early morning, moisture continues to increase through the column as a prefrontal inverted trof and convergence zone develops mainly across E MA/RI. The moisture plume peaks with PWATs reaching 1.00-1.20 inches (nearly 2 std deviations above normal after sunrise Wed). The lift provided by the convergence boundary and incoming front will lead to a band of light- moderate rainfall developing early morning then peaking by mid morning, especially across E MA/RI. Lift/moisture drops off rapidly to the NW, so am still somewhat uncertain on exact placement of the cutoff for precipitation. Will focus highest categorical POPs along the axis convergence in the ECMWF, mainly E of a line from central CT through the Worcester hills. By afternoon, punch of dry air following the cold frontal passage should allow for precip to rapidly end and skies to clear from W-E, such that much of S New England may see the sun before it sets. This is a little bit slower, as the more robust ECMWF suggests development of meso-low pres at the merger point, slowing the pattern. Final QPF will be focused across E MA and RI where peak moisture/lift reside. Final totals approaching an inch are possible, dropping off toward the NW. Will continue to suggest a risk for TS, mainly in the E, where conditionally unstable lapse rates occur thanks to anomalously high sfc dwpts enhance the risk. This also suggests brief heavy downpours possible during the AM commute. Highs tomorrow will be mainly in the low- mid 50s.  Wednesday night...  Skies clear rapidly behind the front through the evening, such that mainly SKC conditions are expected for most of the overnight hours. Even though winds will briefly increase out of the NW thanks to mixing enhanced by differential CAA, am noting enough slackening in the pres gradient by early morning to imply radiational cooling. Therefore, min temps cooler than previous night, with several locations dropping into the 20s by early Thanksgiving morning.",

Potential indications of a near to above seasonal pattern into early December. Noting a +WPO trend with EC/UKmet preference, signals of a deamplifying N Pacific trof-ridge-trof pattern, becoming more zonal, a longer, fast fetch of mild Pacific air aimed into Canada.

Neither Atlantic nor Pacific amplification in the long-range to indicate the zonal pattern will end anytime soon as all other teleconnections are near-neutral, subdued.  An overall quiet pattern, any disturbances progressive, separated to a degree by the split-flow regime governed and slowly sliding E in concert with a trof disturbance over the SE CONUS extending into the Caribbean.

A cold front approaches the region tonight, and will combine with moisture working up the eastern seaboard to bring a period of rain through tomorrow morning, especially SE New England. Quiet weather Thursday and Friday. Another shot of wet weather and breezy conditions Saturday through Monday. Quiet and milder Tuesday and Wednesday, possibly wet and breezy conditions again Thursday.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 3 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING/... Strong subsidence inversion in a regime of continually rising heights this afternoon, have led to mainly SKC conditions outside of a few CI wisps. This has allowed BL mixing to push into the inversion a bit further aloft than previous guidance suggested, and led to some upper 50s and even low 60s for afternoon highs especially away from the coastline, and in the Merrimack valley where some downsloping is occurring.  The sounding is gradually moisture loading from the top down, but have noticed a recent gradual increase in sfc dwpts. The response is a layer of CI building N from offshore, which combined with the maintenance of a strong pres gradient should limit evening decoupling somewhat especially S of the Mass Pike. Mins will likely occur early in the overnight, before 3AM once the lower column moistens. Strong temp gradient will result, with low 30s still possible across the N/NW where some decoupling is possible. Meanwhile, closer to the SE coastline temps are likely to remain in the upper 40s and low 50s, given an overall lack of setup for radiational cooling. Precip will hold off through 3AM, see below for more information.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /3 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Early AM through Wed evening... Acute upper lvl shortwave will slide E late tonight from the Great Lakes, deepening somewhat as it does so. Merging upper jet setup will allow for ocean cyclogenesis off the mid Atlantic S of the Carolinas after midnight in the equatorward entrance region of the S jet. Meanwhile N jet is associated with slow moving cold front attendant to low pres sliding through ON/QC early AM. All models except the ECMWF and many of its ensemble members were initially keeping each of these features as fully separate entities, even as coastal low pres develops an inverted trof which will impact S New England. 12Z guidance a bit more favorable for at least some phasing of these features, closer to the slower and more amplified ECMWF, which has been more persistent. This forecast update will lean most heavily on the ECMWF given its persistence with this features.  Early morning, moisture continues to increase through the column as a prefrontal inverted trof and convergence zone develops mainly across E MA/RI. The moisture plume peaks with PWATs reaching 1.00-1.20 inches (nearly 2 std deviations above normal after sunrise Wed). The lift provided by the convergence boundary and incoming front will lead to a band of light- moderate rainfall developing early morning then peaking by mid morning, especially across E MA/RI. Lift/moisture drops off rapidly to the NW, so am still somewhat uncertain on exact placement of the cutoff for precipitation. Will focus highest categorical POPs along the axis convergence in the ECMWF, mainly E of a line from central CT through the Worcester hills. By afternoon, punch of dry air following the cold frontal passage should allow for precip to rapidly end and skies to clear from W-E, such that much of S New England may see the sun before it sets. This is a little bit slower, as the more robust ECMWF suggests development of meso-low pres at the merger point, slowing the pattern. Final QPF will be focused across E MA and RI where peak moisture/lift reside. Final totals approaching an inch are possible, dropping off toward the NW. Will continue to suggest a risk for TS, mainly in the E, where conditionally unstable lapse rates occur thanks to anomalously high sfc dwpts enhance the risk. This also suggests brief heavy downpours possible during the AM commute. Highs tomorrow will be mainly in the low- mid 50s.  Tomorrow night... Skies clear rapidly behind the front through the evening, such that mainly SKC conditions are expected for most of the overnight hours. Even though winds will briefly increase out of the NW thanks to mixing enhanced by differential CAA, am noting enough slackening in the pres gradient by early morning to imply radiational cooling. Therefore, min temps cooler than previous night, with several locations dropping into the 20s by early Thanksgiving morning.",

Potential indications of a near to above seasonal pattern into early December. Noting a +WPO trend with EC/UKmet preference, signals of a deamplifying N Pacific trof-ridge-trof pattern, becoming more zonal, a longer, fast fetch of mild Pacific air aimed into Canada. If model stratospheric forecasts are any indication, the main low shifting into NW Europe with slightly higher heights over the CONUS, we lose the Arctic connection via NW fetch, flow more W/SW, the ebb and flow pattern as of late and likely to continue into next weekend relaxing indicating possible milder intrusions with any disturbances sweeping through the continued zonal pattern, lacking an Arctic draw. Neither Atlantic nor Pacific amplification in the long-range to indicate the zonal pattern will end anytime soon as all other teleconnections are near-neutral, subdued.  An overall quiet pattern, any disturbances progressive, separated to a degree by the split-flow regime governed and slowly sliding E in concert with a trof disturbance over the SE CONUS extending into the Caribbean. Warm intrusions ahead, cold air following behind. As it was mentioned above, ebb and flow pattern continues. N/S streams mostly split, however closely watching a Saturday night into Sunday disturbance. Touch upon any threats and/or impacts in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Thursday and Friday...  Quiet. Cooler Thursday, NW winds, colder aloft. Highs below average. Upper 30s to low 40s. High pressure, light winds, clear conditions, opportune radiational cooling into Friday morning with lows in the 20s. Mild Friday, rebound with S winds, highs in the 40s, thickening clouds late.

Wet weather late Saturday into Saturday night, chance PoPs, could see decent rains. Breezy SW winds in advance, not anomalously strong. More concerning is NW winds rear- ward, rapid cyclogenesis occurring outside of the 40N/70W benchmark. Undercutting colder air, steeper lapse rates into Sunday, possible that with H85 winds in excess of 50 mph that we could potentially mix-down gusts that suffice WIND ADVISORY criteria, gusts 46-57 mph.

Column remains dry under the ridge`s influence, so expecting a quiet day in terms of precip. The only fly in the ointment will be another round of gusty winds, this time mainly S-SW. H92 LLJ hovers near 35-40 kt, and the limited mixing beneath the continued inversion should limit mixing to this height. Therefore, feel most gusts/sustained winds will remain below wind advisory thresholds, but it will be breezy nonetheless as mixing should still yield gusts 25-35mph.  Tomorrow night... Area of weak low lvl convergence develops ahead of approaching cold front associated with sharpening shortwave approaching from the W during the overnight hours. Column begins dry, with PWATs generally at or below normal values through at least midnight local, so feel the development of any precip will be mainly in the morning hours, especially closest to daybreak as low pres develops near the mid atlantic. A slight increase in moisture, with PWATs then approaching 1 std deviation above normal occurs as the convergence develops in the form of an inverted trof linked to the coastal low well to the S. An area of rainfall will develop along this axis and shift into S New England from the S through sunrise. Note there is still some uncertainty on exactly where this axis sets up, but current data suggests a focus from Westerly to Boston and points SE, with lower risk to the NW. POP gradient reflects this thinking. Leaned away from GFS/NAM, which continue to be easterly outliers and mainly offshore and added more weight to the more amplified ECMWF which remains consistent.

High latitude blocking persists over Greenland to near the North Pole which results in the southward displacement of the Polar Vortex over SE Canada. Series of northern stream shortwaves rotating around this vortex will swing through New Eng on Wed, Thu/Thu night and again Sun/Mon.

Southern stream moisture assocd with a sfc low to the south and inverted trof lifts north into SNE and interacts with mid level trough approaching from the west and right entrance region of the upper jet.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING/... Although BL mixing with sunshine through the day has led to a general drying in the near sfc levels, there remains a modest connection to Great Lake moisture, trapped in a narrow, nearly 100mb band between H85 and H75. This, combined with steepened low lvl lapse rates and weak PVA/shortwave sliding across the area, have allowed for low SC/CU and even an isolated SHSN shifting into interior MA/CT, however this is likely only flurry activity at best. The better chance for light accums remains the E slopes of the Berkshires through evening, in the shadow of enhanced upslope out of the Hudson Valley.  These SHSN should cutoff this evening as low-mid lvl flow begins to back to the SW, cutting off the Lake moisture. Combined with rising mid lvl heights and developing subsidence inversion, will be allowing POPs to gradually drop to nil through 00Z this evening. Otherwise, in spite of the backing flow leading to more return flow overnight, the subsidence inversion will lead to overall column drying yielding mainly SKC conditions once the afternoon/evening clouds diminish. Mass fields also favor a slight weakening of the pres gradient so interior decoupling should allow for some radiational cooling during the overnight. The return flow does suggest a slight increase in sfc dwpts overnight, but this will be countered by the cooling. Therefore, will still see mins dipping into the 20s and low-mid 30s across the region.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/... Tomorrow... Weak mid lvl ridge and attendant sfc high pres center will begin to pass to the E of the region during the morning tomorrow. This will act to enhance the S-SW flow through the day, leading to increased low lvl moisture and rising dwpts/low lvl temps. H95 temps are progged to reach near +5C by late afternoon, which should allow high temps to rebound nicely into the low-mid 50s with a few spots in the upper 50s to near 60 by mid afternoon. Column remains dry under the ridge`s influence, so expecting a quiet day in terms of precip. The only fly in the ointment will be another round of gusty winds, this time mainly S-SW. H92 LLJ hovers near 35-40 kt, and the limited mixing beneath the continued inversion should limit mixing to this height. Therefore, feel most gusts/sustained winds will remain below wind advisory thresholds, but it will be breezy nonetheless as mixing should still yield gusts 25-35mph.  Tomorrow night... Area of weak low lvl convergence develops ahead of approaching cold front associated with sharpening shortwave approaching from the W during the overnight hours. Column begins dry, with PWATs generally at or below normal values through at least midnight local, so feel the development of any precip will be mainly in the morning hours, especially closest to daybreak as low pres develops near the mid atlantic. A slight increase in moisture, with PWATs then approaching 1 std deviation above normal occurs as the convergence develops in the form of an inverted trof linked to the coastal low well to the S. An area of rainfall will develop along this axis and shift into S New England from the S through sunrise. Note there is still some uncertainty on exactly where this axis sets up, but current data suggests a focus from Westerly to Boston and points SE, with lower risk to the NW. POP gradient reflects this thinking. Leaned away from GFS/NAM, which continue to be easterly outliers and mainly offshore and added more weight to the more amplified ECMWF which remains consistent.  With the continued influence of low-mid lvl moisture manifesting as increasing clouds and rising dwpts overnight mins will be mild compared to previous nights, mainly in the low 40s E of a line from Hartford to Beverly, then mid thirties further inland, where clouds will take longest to influence.",

Highlights...  * Morning rain Wed, especially SE New Eng, then clearing afternoon * Mainly dry and cool Thanksgiving Day and Friday * Milder with a chance of showers Sat * Blustery and colder Sun/Mon  Overview...  Models are in good agreement on the overall pattern in the extended period. High latitude blocking persists over Greenland to near the North Pole which results in the southward displacement of the Polar Vortex over SE Canada. Series of northern stream shortwaves rotating around this vortex will swing through New Eng on Wed, Thu/Thu night and again Sun/Mon.

The coldest period will be late Sun/Mon as deep trough settles over New Eng but a brief warm up to milder than normal temps Sat ahead of this deepening trough.

Also noted that daytime mixing is reasonably efficient given the shortwave rotating through, which suggests highs a bit warmer as well. Otherwise, breezy conditions persist until this wave is fully exiting the region.  Previous Discussion...  Fairly high amplitude mid level mean trough moving through the region this morning with 500 mb temps down to about -36C over Lake Ontario per early morning SPC mesoanalysis. This instability combined with cyclonic flow over the northeast yielding periods of cloudiness across southern New England. Embedded with this large scale flow are a few lake effect snow streamers from NY state traversing CT into RI with another band over northwest MA.  00z NAM and other hi res guidance capturing these narrow lake effect bands very well, so leaned on this guid for the morning hours. Not expecting much snow but a few of these bands may briefly lower vsby and leave a quick dusting or coating behind. However most locations will remain dry. By afternoon model low level streamlines indicates trajectory will shift into northwest MA. Thus any snow shower/flurries this afternoon will be focused over this region.  Otherwise a mix of sun and clouds today, chilly with blustery W-NW winds up to 35 mph. Colder than normal with highs only 40-45 except only mid to upper 30s across the high terrain.

Noting inverted troughing off the Carolina coast with S-SE winds bringing surge of low level moisture up the coast on the backside of the high, then gets caught up in the S-SW flow ahead of approaching cold front. Models continue to signal weak tropical or subtropical low form off the FL coast which will ride NE in the low level flow.

Highlights...  * Dry conditions and blustery NW winds Monday * Moderating temperatures Tuesday into early Wednesday * Dry but chilly for Thanksgiving day and Friday  Overview...  Overall progressive mid level pattern continues across North America through most of the long term period, with a few fast moving H5 short waves in the northern stream flow. There may be scattered showers with milder temperatures ahead of the short wave and surface frontal passages, followed by colder temps and some gusty winds especially on Monday. May see some amplification of the mid level flow across the eastern half of the U.S. around mid week, which continues to show some signs of model solution spread giving a bit lower confidence in timing the surface front through. Models in better agreement in bringing some southern stream moisture up the eastern seaboard as cold front approaches around the Wednesday timeframe. The front remains progressive, and should push offshore Wed night, just in time for dry but cooler conditions for the Thanksgiving day HS football games. Temps look to remain on the cool side at the end of the week.  Details...  Monday into Tuesday...High confidence. Another weak disturbance in the W-NW flow should remain dry but will bring colder air across the region as it moves through the northern extent of the large high pressure are settling across the southern Appalachians and SE U.S. on Monday.  May see some lake effect snow shower streamers try to cross the Berkshires into western areas, mainly near the E slopes and the northern CT Valley especially late morning into the early evening hours. At this point, should see only light activity.  Not expecting temps to recover much during the day with W-NW winds gusting up to 30-40 mph, highest across the higher terrain and east coastal areas through midday, then should slowly diminish. Excellent cold air advection with H85 temps down to -10C to -12C through midday with little change in the afternoon. Expect highs only in the lower-mid 30s across the higher terrain ranging to the lower 40s along the immediate coast.  NW flow early Tuesday will back to SW as the large high pressure center shifts E during the day. Will see return of milder temps as readings top off in the mid 40s to mid 50s, with a few upper 50 degree readings possible across S coastal areas. A cold front will approach late in the day but will remain dry.  Tuesday night and Wednesday...Moderate confidence. Expect the cold front to push quickly across, but most of the energy and moisture will remain across northern New England into southern Quebec. Good pressure gradient sets up between the high exiting to the E and the approaching front. Plus, models continue to signal moisture working up the eastern seaboard from developing southern stream mid level system across S GA/FL into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Still some timing issues amongst the model suite, but showing a bit better continuity in bringing precip across most areas except N central and NW Mass Tue night, then will push E Wed. May see a decent shot of QPF amounts during Wed as the moisture feed moves across eastern areas with 0.2 to 0.3 inches possible before ending. Kept CHC POPs going, with best chances across S coastal areas. High temps Wed will top off a few degrees either side of seasonal normals.  Winds shift to W as the front exits late Wed into Wed night, bringing yet another shot of colder air from central Canada.  Thanksgiving and Friday...Moderate to high confidence. High pressure sets up from New England southwestward through the Ohio Valley into the mid Mississippi Valley by midday Thanksgiving day, then slowly shifts S Thu night and Friday. Models trying to bring another low toward the region from Manitoba and western Ontario late Friday, but model solution spread on timing and track of this system.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/... 4 AM update...  *** Strong Southwest Winds Along The South Coast This Morning Followed By Strong West Winds This Afternoon All Areas ***  This Morning...  983 mb low over western NY at 4 am and will continue to intensify as mid level short wave approaching from the west takes on a negative tilt. Strong 130 kt upper level jet streak associated with this feature with its LFQ overspreading southern New England this morning, enhancing QG forcing. This combined with a plume of subtropical PWATs of 1.5 inches (+2 STD) will yield in some locally heavy downpours.  Some support from 00z meso guidance that a broken fine line of low top convection may try to develop along and ahead of the approaching cold front from about 10z-15z. Dew pts rising into the mid and upper 50s this morning providing a few hundred joules of SB cape. Thus could be enough instability coupled with the very strong forcing for ascent to yield some embedded convective elements. These heavier showers may transport strong winds aloft down to the surface. Greatest risk of this occurring will be along the south coast, Cape Cod and Islands where core of low level jet traverses this morning.  Low level jet (925 mb) peaks at 60-65 kt around 12z, however model soundings indicate steep inversion precluding much mixing and will likely keep winds below High Wind Warning criteria. Thus after collaboration with OKX High Wind Warnings for south coastal MA/RI and coastal CT will be downgraded to wind advisory. Thus thinking wind damage will not be widespread but rather more localized. At 4 am highest wind gusts so far 37 kt at EWB. So capped gusts to about 45 kt and sustained to 25-30 kt.  As for temperatures, impressive thermal advection ahead of the approaching cold front into southern New England with 4 am temps in the low 60s across RI and southeast MA! Shallow cool air in the CT river valley finally getting scoured out by heavier showers.  Rainfall amounts will average 0.25 to 0.50 inches but could locally have amounts up to 0.75 inches in heavier downpours given PWATs up to 1.5 inches. Not expecting any flood issues.  This Afternoon...  Strong cold front moving offshore around midday. Intensifying 979 mb low over ME will provide strong pres gradient and combine with CAA to steepen low level lapse rates and good pres rise-fall couplet to support WNW post frontal winds up to 40 kt. Thus will continue wind advisories for the entire region, as there could be isolated wind damage behind the front. Morning clouds and showers will give way to partial afternoon sunshine with temps falling behind the front.",

All mesoscale guid advects low level moisture from the lakes and steepening low level lapse rates into the region. Will have to monitor later model trends to be more specific on these potential mesoscale snow bands. For now just inserted slight chance pops into the forecast.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...  Highlights...  * Dry conditions and blustery NW winds Monday * Moderating temperatures Tuesday into early Wednesday * Dry but chilly for Thanksgiving day and Friday  Overview...  Overall progressive mid level pattern continues across North America through most of the long term period, with a few fast moving H5 short waves in the northern stream flow. There may be scattered showers with milder temperatures ahead of the short wave and surface frontal passages, followed by colder temps and some gusty winds especially on Monday. May see some amplification of the mid level flow across the eastern half of the U.S. around mid week, which continues to show some signs of model solution spread giving a bit lower confidence in timing the surface front through. Models in better agreement in bringing some southern stream moisture up the eastern seaboard as cold front approaches around the Wednesday timeframe. The front remains progressive, and should push offshore Wed night, just in time for dry but cooler conditions for the Thanksgiving day HS football games. Temps look to remain on the cool side at the end of the week.  Details...  Monday into Tuesday...High confidence. Another weak disturbance in the W-NW flow should remain dry but will bring colder air across the region as it moves through the northern extent of the large high pressure are settling across the southern Appalachians and SE U.S. on Monday.  May see some lake effect snow shower streamers try to cross the Berkshires into western areas, mainly near the E slopes and the northern CT Valley especially late morning into the early evening hours. At this point, should see only light activity.  Not expecting temps to recover much during the day with W-NW winds gusting up to 30-40 mph, highest across the higher terrain and east coastal areas through midday, then should slowly diminish. Excellent cold air advection with H85 temps down to -10C to -12C through midday with little change in the afternoon. Expect highs only in the lower-mid 30s across the higher terrain ranging to the lower 40s along the immediate coast.  NW flow early Tuesday will back to SW as the large high pressure center shifts E during the day. Will see return of milder temps as readings top off in the mid 40s to mid 50s, with a few upper 50 degree readings possible across S coastal areas. A cold front will approach late in the day but will remain dry.  Tuesday night and Wednesday...Moderate confidence. Expect the cold front to push quickly across, but most of the energy and moisture will remain across northern New England into southern Quebec. Good pressure gradient sets up between the high exiting to the E and the approaching front. Plus, models continue to signal moisture working up the eastern seaboard from developing southern stream mid level system across S GA/FL into the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  Still some timing issues amongst the model suite, but showing a bit better continuity in bringing precip across most areas except N central and NW Mass Tue night, then will push E Wed. May see a decent shot of QPF amounts during Wed as the moisture feed moves across eastern areas with 0.2 to 0.3 inches possible before ending. Kept CHC POPs going, with best chances across S coastal areas. High temps Wed will top off a few degrees either side of seasonal normals.  Winds shift to W as the front exits late Wed into Wed night, bringing yet another shot of colder air from central Canada.  Thanksgiving and Friday...Moderate to high confidence. High pressure sets up from New England southwestward through the Ohio Valley into the mid Mississippi Valley by midday Thanksgiving day, then slowly shifts S Thu night and Friday. Models trying to bring another low toward the region from Manitoba and western Ontario late Friday, but model solution spread on timing and track of this system.

Weather theme remains the same, periods of rain overnight with heavier convective elements developing ahead approaching cold front roughly 10z/5am thru 16z/11am.  May not be enough instability for thunder during this period but all mesoscale guid has convective elements in the form of heavier showers. This may be when our greatest wind threat occurs as shallow but robust updrafts and precip drag transport strong winds aloft to the surface.  Low level jet /925 mb/ peaks at 65 kt around 12z over south coast including Cape Cod and the Islands. This also coincides with the period of strongest forcing for ascent as LFQ of 130 kt enhances QG forcing and combines with frontal convergence from approaching cold front. Dew pts rising to 55-60 during this time provides a few hundred joules of CAPE. Low and mid level lapse rates are marginal at 6C/KM but this maybe sufficient to support a broken fine line of low top convection 10z-16z. Nonetheless, headlines remain unchanged.  Previous discussion...  Tonight...  */ Highlights...   - Strong to damaging SSW winds along S-coastal RI and MA  - Widespread rain with embedded heavier downpours, possible t`storms  - With t`storms, potential aid in mixing down strong, damaging winds  */ Overview...  Strong to damaging southwesterly wind threats developing out ahead of a deepening area of low pressure across the E Great Lakes, the trailing cold front of which sweeping S New England is the focus of widespread rain with embedded heavier showers and the possibility of thunderstorms.  Nose of strong warm air advection (WAA) within atmospheric sounding profiles around H8, ushered by a well agreed upon 60-80 mph SW jet around H925-8, lending to a steep lapse rates aloft. Attendant low- level frontal convergence / lift with the cold front beneath robust mid-level vortmax, QG-forcing, and the left front quadrant H3 jet, subsequent deep layer ascent in an area of high shear as the H5 trof undergoes its negative tilt obtaining cyclonic curvature. Conveyor belt motions enhancing with the ingest of a continental sub-tropical airmass (cT) with H925-7 thetaE exceeding 320K, surface dewpoints surging to around 50 to 60F, especially SE New England, as drier air impinges from the SW, sharpening, as the cold conveyor belt drives in from the NW behind the H85-7 mid-level low, descending. Thermal gradients tightening with time.  All coming together shortly after midnight towards the early morning hours Sunday, both strong SW jet and strong dynamics. Out ahead of a continued deepening surface low down to 980 mb across the E Great Lakes towards NE VT.  */ Threats and Impacts (in priority)...  Winds...  Strong to damaging wind threat is apparent. However the challenge is in regards to WAA around H8, increasing the low-level inversion more so over the Labrador Current looping down off the coast of the Outer Cape and Nantucket. It`s here that mixing may not be as prevalent. A lot of model consensus sounding profiles and ensemble means capture this fairly well. However, elsewhere mean surface to H9 lapse rates average around 6-7 C/km with consensus model forecast winds at roughly 0.5 km agl (just above 1500 feet) 60 to 70 mph.  Based on wind climatology for SW cases along with forecast rules of thumb, HIGH WIND WARNINGS have been posted along the S-coast of RI and MA including the Islands for tonight with WIND ADVISORIES just to the adjacent N. STORM WARNINGS over the southern waters including Narragansett Bay.  There are moderate probability signals from NCAR and EC ensembles that do justify such headlines, including the HREF signaling a decent probability of sustained 10m 35 mph winds along the S coast.  Strong to damaging SW wind gusts forecast, considering that some trees still have leaves, there are potential impacts of downed trees and/or tree limbs possibly resulting in power outages, structural damage, and/or blocked roadways.  Rain and Convection...  Undoubtedly widespread rain with embedded heavy downpours. Initially with the warm front this evening, perhaps a lull around midnight, then along the cold front thereafter into Sunday morning.  Depending on parcel lift, there is potential at various levels for some weak instability up to 100-200 J/kg, especially within the low levels as colder air undercuts right along the cold front. Given the shear and strong lifting and ascent mechanisms, with any instability can see storm organize. And along focusing boundaries, particularly the cold front and leading nose of the dry slot, could see fine-line convection develop. Rumbles of thunder along with heavier rain, can not rule out mechanical mix-down/precipitation drag of faster winds aloft to the surface aiding in the potential for strong to damaging wind gusts. No particular area of focus, however if the 3 km NAM is correct, could see clusters of heavier downpours, possible thunder- storms, with perhaps a fine-line along the nose of the dry slot going into Sunday.  Fast moving, precipitable waters nudging towards 1.5 inches, around +2 standard deviations per NCEP SREF, looking at a widespread 0.5 to 0.75 inches of rain with possible amounts up around an inch in spots (higher confidence along the S/W slopes of high terrain). Most of it falling around midnight into the morning hours, should be able to handle it, do not perceive a flooding threat.",

Late Morning Sunday into Sunday night...  */ Highlights...   - Post-frontal winds W/NW driving in colder air  - Widespread 40 to 45 mph wind gusts forecast  - Areas of greatest impact across the high terrain, along the coast  */ Discussion...  Strong post-frontal W/NW winds across S New England with widespread 40 to 45 mph gusts. In response to the surface low deepening down to 975 mb into SE Canada, well agreed upon by the consensus of forecast guidance, expecting a strong pressure couplet especially across N New England with pressure rises on the backside of the system up as high as 3 mb / hr. Gradient / isallobaric wind response drives W/NW flow with the top of the mix layer up to H85, dry adiabatic lapse rates, subsequent of under-cutting colder air, where the top of the mixed layer winds average 45 to 55 mph (40 to 50 kts), a few of the models suggesting upwards of 60 mph.

Corroborating signals from both CIPS analogs and EC ensemble that support such headlines.  Again, with strong to damaging NW wind gusts forecast, considering that some trees still have leaves, there are potential impacts of downed trees and/or tree limbs possibly resulting in power outages, structural damage, and/or blocked roadways.  Otherwise, drier air surging in aloft behind the quick sweeping cold front, will see an end to shower activity rather abruptly during the morning hours.

Overall 12z guidance is in general agreement, however guidance spread occurs with each potential shortwave and frontal systems that pass through.

Departing shortwave from the north will increase the pressure gradient and thus anticipate gusty westerly winds to continue during the day. Anticipate a mostly dry day, but could see ocean effect showers across the open waters.  Mid-level ridge will pass through overnight into Tuesday as winds switch and WAA returns across southern New England. Temperatures will warm within this southwesterly wind as 50`s return back to the region. Approaching cold front from the west will result in a developing LLJ with 925mb winds reaching 40-45 kts. Once again another windy evening for Tuesday.  Wednesday into Thanksgiving...Moderate confidence.  Approaching cold front from the Great Lakes will result in a mild start on Wednesday. Depending on the available moisture, scattered showers may develop along and/or ahead of the front. Both the EC and CMC have continued to show precip chances while the GFS keeps the bulk of the moisture offshore. Will continue to ride with chc pops until guidance spread decreases.  Behind the front, CAA will move back into the region for Thursday. Continue with the dry trend for the later half of the day as the 12z GFS deterministic run appears to be an outlier with its developing coastal low. Most of the GEFS also keeps the developing low well offshore like the CMC. This developing low is also not supported by the UKMET or the EC. Therefore anticipate a chilly day as temps fall below seasonable with dry conditions.  Friday and beyond...Increasing confidence.  Increasing cloud cover overnight as secondary cold front swings through. However, temps will begin to moderate as pattern turns a bit more zonal.

Strengthening low pressure moves across W NY state tonight with warm air, strong winds and showers impacting southern New England. The attending cold front sweeps across the area midday Sunday with strong winds ahead and behind the front. Dry and cold conditions move across the region Sunday night and Monday. Mild and dry weather Tuesday ahead of a cold front which brings a risk for showers Tuesday night and Wednesday, followed by dry and colder weather Thanksgiving day.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  10 am update...  Dry weather with increasing clouds. If the 12z soundings are any indication, there is still a lot of dry air in place with both Albany, Upton, and Chatham observing precipitable waters, the total amount of moisture throughout the column if it were squeezed out, around 0.22 inches. SW isentropic ascent ongoing along the 290-310K surfaces over the OH River Valley as initial mid-level energy pushes E against the retreating ridge of high pressure over New England, it`ll take some time for the column to moisten allowing precipitation to reach the surface. Clouds gradually lowering and thickening with time, looking at rain moving in closer to sunset and overspreading the region into evening. S winds on the increase as surface low pressure deepens across the E Great Lakes towards a model consensus of 985 mb by 7 pm.  Filtered sunshine along with warm S flow, looking at highs rebounding into the mid to upper 40s, low 50s along the S/SE coast, from widespread overnight lows around the 20s with spot locations in the upper teens. Coolest conditions across the N/W high terrain. Increasing surface dewpoints into the 40s will give somewhat a more mild feel to the air.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM SUNDAY/...  Early AM update...  *** Strong SSW Winds South Coastal MA and RI *** *** Possible Fine Line of low convection ***  Tonight and Sunday Morning...  Wind Threat...  Strong low level jet overspreads the south coast tonight. Good agreement from models on magnitude of jet 55-60 kt at 925 mb. Model soundings initially show low level lapse rates favorable this evening for 35-40 kt transfer in gusts. But as the night progresses strong WAA steepens low level inversion with gusts becoming less of a factor and sustained winds becoming the main issue with speeds 25- 30 kt. This will be sufficient to support wind advisory for the entire south coast including Cape Cod and the Islands.  Rain and Convective Threat...  Periods of rain with warm front lifting north across the region. Impressive warm sector for mid to late Nov overspreads the area late tonight with dew pts surging to 55-60! Thus temps will rise overnight toward 60 in the coastal plain. This will set the stage for a potential fine line of low top convection toward daybreak Sunday from west to east. Short wave energy merges into a negative tilt trough approaching the region toward 12z Sunday. Also a strong upper level jet streak of 130 kt approaches from the southwest 12z Sunday with LFQ over southern New England, enhancing QG forcing. In addition very strong frontal convergence as low pres deepens to 982 mb over NY state. Thus very strong forcing for ascent in a high shear environment. With dew pts rising to near 60 a few hundred joules of CAPE advects across the area, anomalous for mid to late Nov. However limiting factor for convection is marginal low and mid level lapse rates. So question becomes will there be sufficient instability to yield a strong response at the surface in the form of fine low of convection. Unfortunately model timeframe here is 36-42 hrs, on edge of our mesoscale guid with HREFv2 only out to 36 hrs. However the NCAR ensembles, ARW and NMMB all hint at possible fine line in simulated reflectivity fields. For now will insert slight chance thunder with gusty winds and heavy downpours as PWATs climb to 1.5 inches (+2 standard deviations).  Sunday Afternoon...  *** Strong Post Frontal Winds likely ***  979 mb low traversing northern New England/St Lawrence River Valley will yield strong pres gradient, post frontal CAA and impressive pres rise-fall couplet for a period of strong WNW post frontal winds Sunday afternoon with speeds of 40 to 50 mph possible. Later shifts will have to evaluate model trends for possible issuance of wind advisories for Sunday afternoon. Drying trend behind the fropa along with temps falling from morning highs near 60.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...  Highlights...  * Strong W-NW winds linger Sunday night into Monday * Some question whether moisture tries to work up the eastern   seaboard around the Tue night/Wed timeframe as cold front passes * Temperatures fluctuate day to day, from mild to cold back to mild   again through most of the work week  Overview...  Overall mid level steering pattern across the lower 48 remains progressive through most of the long term periods. However, noting some members of the 00Z model suite try to dig a long wave H5 trough along the eastern seaboard around the late Tuesday into Wednesday timeframe, which may try to capture some southern stream moisture and push it up the eastern seaboard as a cold front passes across the region. The trough appears to retreat northward late Wed night or Thu, then becomes nearly zonal in the northern stream by the end of next week while another northern stream trough starts to dig into the Pacific northwest.  Models and ensembles continue to signal fluctuating temperatures as progressive short wave troughs and ridges move across the region. So, will see mild temps ahead of approaching frontal systems, then a cool down after the systems pass. By the end of the week, temps may feel more like early winter than late autumn.  Used a blend of available guidance for the majority of the forecast, though opted closer to a 00Z GGEM/ECMWF blend for Tue night/Wed with possible influx of moisture into the region ahead and with the approaching cold front.  Details...  Sunday night through Monday night...  H5 short wave digs across into E PA/N NJ and steadily shifts E which will bring another shot of cooler air as well as gusty W-NW winds. As the strong surface low, on order of sub-980 hPa across N Maine into the Gulf of St Lawrence will exit with a tight pressure gradient in place. Also, both the GFS and NAM BUFKIT soundings showing deep momentum transfer, possibly up to 800 hPa across inland areas from Monday morning through early afternoon. There is also excellent low level lapse rates up to H85, up to 8-9C/km. So, could see gusts up to 35 to 45 mph, possibly higher across the higher inland terrain and along the coast at times. Have kept mention of the potential of strong gusts in the HWO for this timeframe.  Expect dry conditions during this time, but some question whether any lake effect snow bands may reach into western areas during Monday on the strong W-NW winds. At this point, kept a dry forecast going.  Strong cold air advection continues behind the departing low, with H85 temps down to -10C to -12C overnight into Monday morning and not changing much during the day Monday. So, expect highs possibly holding in the lower-mod 30s across the higher terrain of N central and NW Mass, ranging to 40-45 across the coastal plain. With the gusty winds, it will feel more like the upper teens to mid 20s inland to 30-35 along the shore.  Tuesday...  High pressure builds across the mid Atlantic and SE states, with northern ridging passing across the region. Winds will back to SW by Tue afternoon as the high pushes off the coast. Could see gusts up to 25-30 kt along the immediate S coast, Cape Cod and the islands late in the day. May see some mid and high clouds work into western areas Tue afternoon. Will likely see the mildest temps of the week during this time as highs are forecast to be in the 45-50 degree range inland and the mid 50s across N CT to the coastal plain.  Tuesday night and Wednesday...  Cold front approaches, so will see clouds increase. Associated low pressure will shift across southern Ontario and Quebec in the fast flow aloft. There are some questions as to the evolution of the eastern U.S. pattern during this timeframe, as there is wide model solution spread handling the H5 pattern. Some models trying to dig an H5 trough to the mid Atlantic or SE U.S. while one model member actually cuts off H5 low across S GA/FL.  At this point, the front should push offshore, but the big question will be whether the timing of the front and a weakness in the H5 pattern may be enough to allow some southern stream moisture to work NE along the eastern seaboard across the region. At this point, have introduced CHC POPs Tue night into Wed, then shift E late Wed into Wed night. Have lower confidence due to wide solution spread.  Expect highs on Wed to run close to or just above seasonal normals, though temps will start to fall as NW winds take over later Wed.  Thanksgiving and Friday...  At this point, looks like dry conditions will be in place at the end of next week as high pressure ridge builds in from the west as the northern stream steering flow becomes nearly zonal. Some clouds may push in across the Cape and islands on Friday as low pressure passes well SE of the region.  Looks to be a chilly Thanksgiving day with highs only in the mid 30s to around 40 inland and the lower-mid 40s at the shore. It may be a bit milder on Friday, with highs mainly in the 40s, but some upper 30s may linger across the higher inland terrain.",

Ebb and flow continues. Without greater amplification and subsequent transfer between the equator and the poles, the flow remains mainly zonal. The MJO largely subdued as the present -WPO/-EPO/-PNA all trend positive into December per ensemble means, counter-productive, lending seemingly to a signal of persistent W to E flow. The only consistencies it seems from analysis of potential vorticity and isentropic surfaces is a persistence of poleward transfer in the N Pacific and the NE Atlantic that lends to S shearing of energy into the Gulf of Alaska and S across Europe, respectively. Otherwise it`s zonal in-between. Any energy across the CONUS is quick moving with little residency such that forces acting to invoke greater curvature and storm development reach their full potential E of our region across E/SE Canada into the NW Atlantic. With racing storm systems over our region, warm-surge in advance followed by cool shots, both with attributes of gusty winds, a chance of wet-weather in-between along associated frontal boundaries, cold fronts with more emphasis. Attendant threats and impacts highlighted in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Sunday into Monday...  Winds shifting NW ushering colder air, remaining blustery. Consensus of forecast guidance, cold front sweeping 7-10a Sunday, undercutting colder air, lapse rates mixing out to H85, dry adiabatic, the top of the mix layer averaging W/NW 45 to 50 mph (40 to 45 kts). Widespread WIND ADVISORY likely, more likely daytime Sunday with boundary layer heating and contributions from quick pressure rises. Ensemble means, strongest winds likely across the high terrain and along the coast adjacent to 50-degree ocean waters, also N/E closer to the storm center, so N/E portions of MA at greatest threat. CIPS analogs with a high probability of at least 35 mph widespread gusts, lower for 40 to 45 mph, however considering local climatology, believe there is the potential to see 40+ mph gusts.  Headlines may drop overnight with the potential of a shallow surface inversion, however model guidance consensus signals continued cold air advection right into Monday with additional energy rotating through the cyclonic flow across the region lending to an enhancement of the wind profile. Something will have to watch closely.  Will highlight the wind threat in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. No headlines at this time associated with W/NW winds.  Otherwise, drier air surging in aloft behind the quick sweeping cold front, will see an end to shower activity rather abruptly during the morning hours. With the blustery W/NW winds and cold airmass pouring in, across the warmer Great Lakes, the lake effect machine will be ongoing and could see some of that energy reach far enough E with the mean flow to impact N/W portions of MA and CT with some snow and/or rain shower activity, 2m temperature dependent. If snow, some light accumulations are possible, mainly for the high terrain.  All threat diminish into Monday night, and it is during this period that winds may become light enough beneath clear conditions to allow for radiational cooling and night-time lows to drop well down into the 20s, possibly teens. Hard to say right now. If W/NW winds remain brisk, then the mechanical mixing in the environment would limit the radiational cooling potential. Will hold it conservative with wide- spread lows in the 20s. Highs Sunday into the upper 40s to low 50s right before the cold front punches through in the morning, upper 30s to low 40s for Monday.  Tuesday...  Quiet. High pressure. Return S flow. Turning mild. Still believe that warmest temperatures will be over interior SE New England, that an onshore will develop in response to an approaching storm system for the overnight period into Wednesday. Highs in the upper 40s to low 50s.  Tuesday night into Wednesday...  Possible showers. Keeping with slight chance PoPs, the EC on again off again on the N and S stream energy beginning to interact with a draw of S-moisture ahead of the N sweeping cold front before both systems push offshore quickly and phase downstream. The GFS keeps the dry-streak going. Given the emphasis on the cold front agreed upon within all available guidance, would expect that the associated lift on available moisture should get something going, especially considering the warmer ocean waters that line the shore.  Thanksgiving onward...  Thanksgiving looks quiet and seasonable, while into the weekend it appears another quick moving storm system sweeps the region. The ebb and flow pattern continues with milder shots and SW flow ahead of any disturbance followed by colder air and NW winds as the system departs.",

Decided to hold off on a Wind Advisory for this morning. Wind speeds are just beneath criteria and the spotter reports are only indicating isolated minor damage.  Previous Discussion...  Closed mid level low and surface cyclone over Nova Scotia continues to intensify today given trough amplification and associated height falls. This results in modest CAA into southern New England with 850 temps lowering to -6C this morning, about -1 standard deviation colder than climo. This combined with tight pres gradient will result in a chilly morning across the region with NW winds gusting up to 35 mph.  Cold air advection peaks this morning then eases this afternoon as mid level trough moves offshore replaced by height rises across the region. Thus not as windy this afternoon. However temps will only rebound to 40-45, upper 30s across the high terrain, almost 10 degs cooler than normal.  Scattered to broken cold air advection strato-cu this morning will give to mostly sunny conditions this afternoon as temps begin to warm aloft in response to height rises.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM SATURDAY/... 330 AM update...  Tonight...  Ridge of high pres builds across the area from west to east, resulting in a cold night especially outside the urban areas as mostly clear skies combine with light winds and a very dry airmass. For whatever reason MOS has been running too cold in these radiational cooling events this past month so we will follow a model blend here to offset the colder MOS guid. Nonetheless most locations fall into the 20s tonight, upper teens northwest MA and closer to 30 for Boston. Will have to watch mid and high clouds spilling into the area late tonight, which may have an impact on temps with mins possibly not quite as cold.  Saturday...  Chilly start to the day but low level WAA commences with increasing SSW winds during the afternoon and especially late in the day. Some morning sunshine thru high clouds possible, but will fade behind increasing clouds during the afternoon as mid level trough and 985 mb surface cyclone exits Great Lakes. All global guidance including ensembles keep dry weather across the entire region thru 18z Sat. Thereafter showers overspread the area especially western MA/CT. Will have to see how later model runs trend but it`s possible much if not the entire day remains dry across RI and eastern MA.  Low level WAA should result in highs in the 50s across the coastal plain including the Boston to Providence corridor, with 40s farther inland where it will take longer to modify shallow cold air.  SSW winds will increase as low level jet approaches the region. Model soundings suggest wind gusts up to 40 mph along the south coast by late in the day Saturday.",

Progressive mid level steering flow continues through this forecast period across the lower 48. Noting a couple of fast moving low pressure systems in the northern stream, though it appears that the steering flow pushes further N into southern Canada early next week.  Rather strong winds accompany two passing systems, which could produce wind advisory level winds from Saturday night into Monday. The stronger of the two systems passes across southern Quebec Sunday, with gusty SW winds Sat night into Sunday shifting to W-NW Sunday night and Monday.  As the pattern flattens out Monday night, will see another system move across central Quebec closer to Hudson Bay around mid week. Most of the mid level energy and moisture will be well N of the region, so expect dry conditions as another shot of cooler air moves in. High pressure appears to keep fair weather across the region for Thanksgiving though it will be cool with temps running 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal levels.  Details...  Saturday night...  Will see temps rising during the night on mild SW winds. H925 temps rise to +11C to +12C during the night. Will also see gusts up to 35-40 kt possible, highest along the S coast. May get close to Wind Advisory levels, but will monitor as marginal low level lapse rates in place except along the immediate S coast. Have used a non-diurnal temp trend through the night. As cold front moves into western areas toward daybreak, could see some brief higher gusts, up to 45 kt, as winds start to shift to W.  Showers move across through the night, and could see a few heavier downpours across western areas after midnight. This could also help mix some higher winds down with the precip. QPF amounts could reach up to 0.3 to 0.5 inches from central Mass and NE CT westward through the night.  Lows will occur early, ranging from around 40 across the E slopes of the Berks to the lower 50s along the immediate S coast.  Sunday and Monday...  The cold front will push offshore by midday, but could see temps top off in the mid-upper 50s across central and eastern areas before frontal passage. Showers will move E during the day with improving conditions during the afternoon. A few showers might linger into Sunday evening across E coastal areas.  Another round of gusty W-NW winds will move in Sunday and and continue into Monday. Will again have to monitor for Wind Advisory level sustained winds and/or gusts, especially across eastern areas. Best shot for strongest winds looks to occur along the coast, but could also see some of the strong winds across the higher inland terrain.  Temps will drop back to the 20s away from the coast, up to 30-35 on the shoreline Sunday night, with readings only recovering to the 30s inland and 40-45 at the shore on Monday, running 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal levels.  Tuesday and Wednesday...  Low pressure moves E out of Ontario Tuesday, remaining across central Quebec early Wednesday. Associated cold front sweeps across the region Tue night. Most of energy and moisture will remain N of the region, so will just see a wind shift push across. After temps running up to 5 degrees above normal on Tuesday, readings will dip closer to seasonal levels Wednesday.  Wednesday and Thanksgiving...  Mainly dry conditions expected through the holiday as mid level storm track looks to remain N of the region. Winds shift to NW early Wed morning as a dry cold front pushes offshore, followed by large high pressure building E out of the central U.S. toward the eastern seaboard on Thanksgiving.

Nonetheless most locations fall into the 20s tonight, upper teens northwest MA and closer to 30 for Boston. Will have to watch mid and high clouds spilling into the area late tonight, which may have an impact on temps with mins possibly not quite as cold.  Saturday...  Chilly start to the day but low level WAA commences with increasing SSW winds during the afternoon and especially late in the day. Some morning sunshine thru high clouds possible, but will fade behind increasing clouds during the afternoon as mid level trough and 985 mb surface cyclone exits Great Lakes. All global guidance including ensembles keep dry weather across the entire region thru 18z Sat. Thereafter showers overspread the area especially western MA/CT. Will have to see how later model runs trend but it`s possible much if not the entire day remains dry across RI and eastern MA.  Low level WAA should result in highs in the 50s across the coastal plain including the Boston to Providence corridor, with 40s farther inland where it will take longer to modify shallow cold air.  SSW winds will increase as low level jet approaches the region. Model soundings suggest wind gusts up to 40 mph along the south coast by late in the day Saturday.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...  Highlights...  * Gusty SW winds Saturday night will shift to W-NW Sunday into   Monday, with some strong gusts during each day * Milder air moves across the region Tuesday, only to exit as   another cold front brings colder air and gusty winds at mid   week * Early outlook for Thanksgiving appears to be dry but cool  Overview...  Progressive mid level steering flow continues through this forecast period across the lower 48. Noting a couple of fast moving low pressure systems in the northern stream, though it appears that the steering flow pushes further N into southern Canada early next week.  Rather strong winds accompany two passing systems, which could produce wind advisory level winds from Saturday night into Monday. The stronger of the two systems passes across southern Quebec Sunday, with gusty SW winds Sat night into Sunday shifting to W-NW Sunday night and Monday.  As the pattern flattens out Monday night, will see another system move across central Quebec closer to Hudson Bay around mid week. Most of the mid level energy and moisture will be well N of the region, so expect dry conditions as another shot of cooler air moves in. High pressure appears to keep fair weather across the region for Thanksgiving though it will be cool with temps running 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal levels.  Details...  Saturday night...  Will see temps rising during the night on mild SW winds. H925 temps rise to +11C to +12C during the night. Will also see gusts up to 35-40 kt possible, highest along the S coast. May get close to Wind Advisory levels, but will monitor as marginal low level lapse rates in place except along the immediate S coast. Have used a non-diurnal temp trend through the night. As cold front moves into western areas toward daybreak, could see some brief higher gusts, up to 45 kt, as winds start to shift to W.  Showers move across through the night, and could see a few heavier downpours across western areas after midnight. This could also help mix some higher winds down with the precip. QPF amounts could reach up to 0.3 to 0.5 inches from central Mass and NE CT westward through the night.  Lows will occur early, ranging from around 40 across the E slopes of the Berks to the lower 50s along the immediate S coast.  Sunday and Monday...  The cold front will push offshore by midday, but could see temps top off in the mid-upper 50s across central and eastern areas before frontal passage. Showers will move E during the day with improving conditions during the afternoon. A few showers might linger into Sunday evening across E coastal areas.  Another round of gusty W-NW winds will move in Sunday and and continue into Monday. Will again have to monitor for Wind Advisory level sustained winds and/or gusts, especially across eastern areas. Best shot for strongest winds looks to occur along the coast, but could also see some of the strong winds across the higher inland terrain.  Temps will drop back to the 20s away from the coast, up to 30-35 on the shoreline Sunday night, with readings only recovering to the 30s inland and 40-45 at the shore on Monday, running 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal levels.  Tuesday and Wednesday...  Low pressure moves E out of Ontario Tuesday, remaining across central Quebec early Wednesday. Associated cold front sweeps across the region Tue night. Most of energy and moisture will remain N of the region, so will just see a wind shift push across. After temps running up to 5 degrees above normal on Tuesday, readings will dip closer to seasonal levels Wednesday.  Wednesday and Thanksgiving...  Mainly dry conditions expected through the holiday as mid level storm track looks to remain N of the region. Winds shift to NW early Wed morning as a dry cold front pushes offshore, followed by large high pressure building E out of the central U.S. toward the eastern seaboard on Thanksgiving. Noting some model solution spread, though the 00Z GFS and ECMWF were pretty close in their surface high pres position. Looks like temps will run close to or a bit below seasonal levels.",

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/...  10 pm update...  Post frontal airmass has overspread the area with dew pts falling into the 30s on westerly flow. However additional short waves will rotate thru the long wave trough overnight with each impulse providing colder/drier air to advect across the region. This colder air streaming across Lake Ontario has begun to produce lake effect rain showers across NY state and PA. Some of these showers may spill over the Berkshires in the upslope flow into western MA. Previous forecast captures these details so no major changes with this forecast update. Earlier discussion below.  ==================================================================  So shifting into the colder air as the storm center parent with the secondary low development offshore deepens up across Maine into SE Canada. Will see lapse rates steepen during the overnight period allowing for the effective mix down of faster winds to the surface. Increasing W/NW sustained with towards 20 to 25 mph, especially across the waters and over the high terrain, with gusts up to 40 mph, just short of WIND ADVISORY criteria.  Lows falling into the 30s, wind chills in the 20s. Watching NW MA along the spine of the Berkshires for likely lake effect influences reaching far E with the advective winds behind the deepening storm system. Could see some light snow accumulations for those areas of the high terrain.",

Max temperatures remain below normal, with wind chills mainly in the 30s.  High pressure centered near the Carolina coast should extend in our direction Friday night. This will permit winds to become less gusty, while also keeping dry weather for most of southern New England.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - S/SE coast strong to damaging SW winds late Sat. into Sat. night  - Widespread strong to damaging W/NW winds Sunday into Sunday night  - Ebb and flow pattern of S warm air surges followed by N cold air  */ Overview...  Ebb and flow. So long as the doors remain open from the N Pacific, across the CONUS, and immediately downstream of New England, will the pattern remain progressive. So with the persistence of Pacific energy sheared S into the NW CONUS and over the N American Rockies, disturbances quickly race E such that forces acting yield greater curvature and subsequent negatively-tilting, dynamic and deepening activity, stronger storm development, over SE Canada rather than our next of the woods. This process aided by the reloading upstream of energy into the NW Pacific and resultant ridging over the W CONUS shearing downstream energy and the polar jet S, aiding in the afore- mentioned cyclogenesis into SE Canada with stronger thermal gradient tightening and energy transfer between equator and pole. So for the most part in our region we see quick moving disturbances with mild air lead ahead by a warm frontal boundary followed swiftly by cold frontal boundaries and temperatures below average. Ebb and flow, the transitions in-between distinguished by wet-weather and gusty winds to which any threat and impact of which will be highlighted in the discussion below.  */ Discussion...  Saturday into Saturday night...  Monitoring for strong, possibly damaging SW winds. Strongest winds 1p Saturday to 7a Sunday, the crux of which are over SE New England. Model consensus H925 SW winds 45 to 60 mph (40 to 55 knots) with the high-res NAM suggesting over 65 mph (60 knots). Also best low-level lapse rates up to H9 averaging around 7 C/km within strongest winds around the I-95 corridor and SE, at least 6 C/km through the event. Looking at a +2 standard deviation SW event per SREF.  A SW event with winds off the maritimes requires faster winds aloft to net WIND ADVISORY criteria. Based on local climatology, typically like to see winds at H925 around 60 mph (55 knots) to support WIND ADVISORIES. Per latest forecast grids we meet WIND ADVISORY criteria along the S/SE coast of RI and MA including S Bristol and S Plymouth Counties in MA beginning Saturday evening and continuing Sunday morning. We stay just below HIGH WIND WARNING criteria. For that in SW cases H925 winds over 65 mph (60 knots) to which a consensus of model forecasts falls just below. No headlines this early as we are currently dealing with a storm presently and don`t want to create confusion. Will continue to highlight the strong to damaging wind threat in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.  Otherwise, warm front sliding NE late Saturday ahead of which will see isentropic upslope lead to showery, nuisance weather, the better chance of which will be closer to the low center NW. Bulk of rain comes towards Sunday morning with the cold front given deep lift and ascent of higher thetaE. However, quick moving, deeper sub-tropical air well S along with higher precipitable waters, and erosion rear- ward by a sharply impinging dry-slot out of the SW. Looking at not much in the way of outcomes a couple to few tenths, no threat of thunder. Warming all the way up prior to the cold frontal passage. Lows Saturday morning but highs may come just prior to midnight, upper 40s to low 50s.  Sunday into Monday...  Winds shifting NW ushering colder air, remaining blustery. No doubt about dry adiabatic lapse rates through Monday up to H85 where the average of winds is around 45 to 50 mph (40 to 45 knots), again the high-res NAM slightly stronger. Widespread impacts however strongest winds may occur over N/E portions of MA considering the proximity to the deepening low into SE Canada and subsequent pressure falls, the greatest of which and subsequent isallobaric contribution occurring Sunday morning. Could see additional emphasis on the winds as energy continues to rotate round the deepening storm system lifting further into E Canada, such emphasis extending into Monday.  For WIND ADVISORY headlines with W/NW flow you`d like to see H925-85 winds 35 to 45 mph (30 to 40 knots) which we easily meet across the entire region. Especially Sunday into Sunday evening, likely we`ll need widespread WIND ADVISORY headlines just based on the consensus of synoptics and considering that some trees still have plenty of leaves. Early for headlines, will highlight this in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.  The lake effect snow machine going, could see some rain and/or snow showers into N/W portions of MA and CT depending on 2m temperatures. Likely the greater threat on Sunday given the cold fetch over the warm lakes and greater cyclonic flow aloft. Light accumulations for N/W MA and CT are not out of the question.  Winds and any additional threats diminish Monday night. Highs Sunday likely right after midnight, possibly into early morning, before temperatures plummet with cold air advection. Around the upper 30s for highs Monday with scattered to broken cloud decks, sunshine peaking through, while overnight lows in the 20s, the colder of which progged into Tuesday morning given clear conditions and light winds, could be talking down into the teens for some. However coldest wind chills Sunday night into Monday morning, also down into the teens.  Tuesday...  Quiet beneath high pressure. Return S flow. Warming back up nicely given SW flow at all levels. However, influence via ageostrophic E flow in response to developing low pressure over the N Great Lakes, leaning that warmest temptress will occur over the SE interior, highs into the 50s, while slightly cooler with an onshore flow over the E/SE coastline.  Tuesday night into Wednesday...  Potential weather. Two pieces of energy, a N and S stream that given the progressive flow look to phase downstream well away from the NE CONUS per the latest 16.12z guidance and noting ensemble means. Could be looking simply at a dry cold frontal passage. Will put some slight chance PoPs for the period.  Wednesday night through the Thanksgiving weekend...  Leaning with a dry pattern. Scattered to broken cloud decks initially with NW flow and possible snowy influences off the lakes. Potential for reinforcing cold air over the region as high pressure settles in. A temperature rebound as the high shifts E ahead of the next upstream disturbance. The ebb and flow pattern continues in the mainly zonal flow.",

Not expecting gusts to exceed that as the colder air arrives.  Attention then turns to the gusty west to northwest winds and potential for additional showers to get into portions of western MA overnight.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/... Showers continue to overspread southern New England this morning. Latest radar mosaic showing a fine-line across portions of central CT and MA. At this time, not thinking this is strong convective development, but merely a function of range to the various radars, where now it is getting close enough to be better sampled.  Examining surrounding surface observations, expecting a sharp wind shift with gusts up to 35 mph across most of the eastern half of southern New England, with a couple of exceptions. First will be across the higher ridgetops of central MA, where slightly higher wind gusts are possible. The second will be across the south coast of RI and MA, where potential convection could lead to stronger wind gusts reaching the ground. The Wind Advisory will continue as is.  Used a blend of high resolution near term models to bring the timing of rainfall back in line with observed trends. Also tweaked temperatures slightly.  Previous Discussion...  *** A brief period of heavy rain & isolated Thunder between 10 am and 4 pm from west to east with the low risk for localized strong wind gusts near the south coast ***  Expect potent short wave to sweep across southern New England late this morning and afternoon, bringing a round of heavy showers, isolated T-storms and strong gusty winds to portions of the area.  Parent low pressure moving across Ontario early this morning gives way to secondary/triple point low development south of New England later this morning. This is in response to strong forcing for ascent from approaching short wave trough. Mid level lapse rates steepen to about 7C/KM. This instability coupled with strong forcing will result in a period of heavy rain with embedded thunder from about 15Z-21Z from west to east across CT/MA/RI. Hi res guidance including the NCAR ensembles, ARW, NMMB and HREFv2 suggest rainfall totals of up to an inch is possible in a fairly short time period. This may result in minor poor drainage/street flooding, especially if elevated convection becomes more widespread.  Other issue today will be the potential for strong winds. Secondary low/cyclogenesis is accompanied by an increasing low level SSE jet that clips the south coast including Cape Cod and the Islands from about 16Z-20Z. Greatest risk for strong winds will be in the warm sector, with model guidance suggesting this will be along the south coast including Cape Cod and the Islands. NAM most robust with strength of low level jet but also has some support from the remainder of the hi res guid. In addition, strong pressure rise-fall couplet across RI and southeast MA this afternoon will aid strong wind potential via enhancing isallobaric wind component. Furthermore heavy showers with embedded thunder and robust but shallow updrafts will further enhance wind threat across this region. Given these factors decided to hoist a wind advisory for the south coast. Day shift may need to consider expanding advisory into southern Bristol and Plymouth counties pending 12z model trends.  As for convective threat, most of convection later this morning and afternoon appears elevated as core of warm sector and 50+ dew pt air remains offshore. So despite very high low level helicity values in vicinity of developing triple point low, SB instability likely gets shunted offshore. Nonetheless will have to monitor potential rotating storms near the south coast, but again likely remain offshore.  As for temps, secondary/triple pt low development will trap low level cool air inland with highs only in the 40s. However farther south warm sector airmass clips south coast, Cape Cod and Islands where temps will climb into the 50s.",

Strong low pressure moving across southern Quebec this weekend will bring another round of showers and blustery winds ahead and behind the quick moving cold front. Gusty northwest winds are likely into early next week, with wind advisories possible. Mainly dry conditions expected through the middle of next week with temps running close to or below normal.  Details...  Friday night...  Deepening low pressure will push across the Gulf of Maine Fri evening. Tightening pressure gradient and cold air advection will bring blustery W-NW winds. Will see gusts up to 25-35 kt across the higher inland terrain and along the immediate coast through around midnight Fri night then will diminish as high pressure builds to the W. May also see leftover snow showers early across portion of the higher terrain of NW Mass.  Expect temps to fall back to the 20s across most areas, except in the 30-35 degree range along the immediate coast.  Saturday through Sunday...  High pressure ridge progresses eastward as the center settles across the Carolinas during Saturday. NW winds will diminish, then shift to SW during the afternoon and begin to increase again ahead of next approaching system.  There is some question on timing of onset of precip associated with approaching cold front. Have quickly increasing POPs during the day, though this will depend how fast the departing ridge moves E. Should see precip move in across most areas by around 21Z with increasing S-SW as well. Strong low pressure will cross central Quebec, with pressure down to around 980 hPa, while a secondary low forms as the occlusion moves across the region. May see SW wind gusts up to 35-40 kt Saturday evening, then will shift quickly to W as the cold front sweeps across May need Wind Advisory headlines for a time Sat night as gusts could approach 45-50 mph at times, highest along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands.  Back edge of precip should shift E Sunday morning, with drier air quickly working in. A few showers may linger into early afternoon across Cape Cod and the islands. Blustery W-NW winds continue with gusts up to 40-45 kt possible once again, so Wind headlines (Wind Advisory or even a few spots up to High Wind Warning criteria possible) may be needed again. Temps will start off close to normal, then will fall quickly by Sunday afternoon as colder air works in. May see a few lingering snow showers over parts of the E slopes of the Berkshires.  Monday...  A few snow showers may linger across the higher terrain of NW Mass through mid morning, otherwise expect dry conditions as high pressure sets up from W of Hudson Bay across the Great Lakes to the SE states. The tight pressure gradient between the departing low pressure across the Maritimes into Labrador and the high S and W of the region will keep temps up to 5 to 10 degrees below seasonal normals for late November. Highs will range from the 30s across the higher inland terrain to the lower 40s across the coastal plain.  Tuesday and Wednesday...  High pressure will progress E off the eastern seaboard on Tuesday as another weak, fast moving low moves across S central Canada. Will see a brief temperature rebound on Tuesday, close to normal readings as winds shift to SW ahead of the approaching front. However, most of the energy and moisture remains N of the region, so will remain dry for the majority of the region as it passes Tue night.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...  10 pm update...  Clouds continue to increase from the south and west this evening. However given much of the cloudiness is mid to high level combined with light winds, this has provided good radiational cooling conditions at ORE-BED-OWD-TAN-PYM-EWB-SFZ with temps in the mid to upper 20s at 930 pm. Thus main change from previous forecast was just to capture these cooler hourly temps. However as clouds lower and onshore flow increases temps will slowly rise overnight.  As previous forecasters mentioned, some light wintry precip may develop across western MA very late tonight but should be very short lived as shallow cold air will erode/dislodge fairly quickly given retreating Maritime high. Previous forecast captures this well so no major changes here. Previous discussion below ...  ===================================================================  A scattered to broken deck of cloudiness this evening will trend towards overcast after midnight. This a result of low pressure across the Great Lakes lifting northeast into southern Canada. Upper level ridging should still maintain dry weather for most of the night. An increasing low level jet/forcing should allow for some showers to impact interior southern New England after 2 or 3 am. There is a low risk for a very brief period of light snow/ice at the onset across the highest terrain of northwest/north central MA, but even if this occurs should be very short-lived.  Low temps should occur by midnight generally in the upper 20s to middle 30s, but readings should slowly rise thereafter as clouds continue to increase.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...  ***A 1 to 3 hour period of heavy rain between noon and 5 pm on Thursday across central/eastern MA and RI with the low risk for localized damaging wind gusts near the south coast***  Thursday...  Scattered showers will be on going Thursday morning in the warm air advection pattern. Attention will then turn to secondary low pressure that will develop off the south coast and rapidly intensity as it lifts northeast. The greatest precipitation amounts look to occur in Maine given the storm is just starting its rapid intensification in our area. However, some of our high resolution guidance has this occurring a bit faster than other models which is certainly possible given the setup. If this occurs, it would bring a higher risk for brief heavy rainfall into our region.  There are two things that will have to watch for on Thursday. The first is a 1 to 3 hour period of heavy rain with the second being the low risk for convection/localized damaging wind gusts near the southeast New England coast.  A 1 to 3 hour heavy rain is expected between noon and 5 pm across central and eastern MA/RI. The heaviest rain may occur in two areas, the first being near and northwest of the I-95 corridor where very strong omega will be associated with the rapidly deepening low pressure system. The second area may remain offshore or it may clip the southeast New England coast in association with the warm sector. If it does get onto the southeast New England coast, rapid pressure falls coupled with steep mid level lapse rates and some instability may result in a few embedded thunderstorms. The pressure falls coupled with any convection may result in a low risk for localized damaging wind gusts near the southeast New England coast. In fact, given the amount of low level helicity and cold temps aloft there is even a very low risk of a waterspout off the south coast.  All in all, odds favor this being the run of the mill nuisance event with a brief period of heavy rain and perhaps brief gusty winds along the southeast New England coast. However, given the dynamics/pressure falls associated with this system that low risk for localized damaging wind gusts associated with possible convection does exist on the southeast New England coast.  Thursday night...  The low pressure system will continue to intensify as it lifts into downeast Maine and away from the region. The result will be dry weather Thursday night other than perhaps a few rain/snow showers along the east slopes of the Berks. The main story will be the increasing pressure gradient which should result in northwest wind gusts of 25 to 35 mph with perhaps a few gusts up to 40 mph. Low temps will be mainly in the 30s, but it will feel colder given the gusty winds.",

Persistence of cooler than average air with shots of mild weather in- between. Individual zonal-flow disturbances over the CONUS this week bottle up over the N Atlantic by the weekend, increasing meridional flow, invoking a brief ridging-block across the Davis Straight as indicated by the -NAO. A digging storm system over the weekend with polar connnections deepening into E Canada becomes trapped briefly, its remnant circulation a focus for additional energy out of the N/W to rotate through resulting in maintenance in addition to shots of Arctic air sweeping S into the NE CONUS. Meanwhile upstream, the N Pacific ridge maintains, downsteam of which energy shears S gaining greater cyclonic curvature and deepening. Subsequent ridging over the W and Central CONUS only aids in the SE transport of colder air. While a return to zonal flow is entirely plausible going into the holiday weekend, the longer term ensemble mean trend suggests that troughing continues over the NW Pacific downstream of which the ridge-trough pattern follows out across an open Atlantic. Believe the cooler and active pattern will continue however without the allowance for deeper storm development into the NE CONUS. Mainly thinking continued quick moving disturbances. Will hit the details in the discussion below. A preference to the 15.12z EC and ensemble means (GEFS and ECens).   */ Discussion...  Friday...  Potential WIND ADVISORY headlines. Behind the deepening departing system into SE Canada, will see a H925 50-55 mph NW jet especially over E/SE New England, the height of which will be bright and early in the morning, diminishing into afternoon. Boundary layer lapse rates up to H9 around 6 C/km should promote the mix down of faster momentum to the surface. Using just a rule of thumb of 70 percent of the top of the mixed layer nets 40 mph. However believe there is the potential for gusts up around 45 mph during the morning before high pressure builds in from the W. Scattered to broken cloud decks that rotate across the region, especially E/NE, clear out towards the overnight period, winds diminishing. Radiational cooling proceeding into Saturday morning, leaning towards the lowest of guidance. Highs in the 40s during the days dropping down to lows in the 20s possibly as low as the teens into Saturday.  Saturday into Monday...  Potent storm system digging across the NE CONUS into E/SE Canada. A polar connection rearward as the system undergoes a negative tilt, obtaining greater cyclonic curvature, the thermal gradient tightens yielding a strong W/SW jet streak response in advance of the system at all levels Saturday night into Sunday. Looking at initial over- running rains as the warm front lifts N over the area late Saturday followed by the main slug out ahead of the primary vortmax and right- front-quadrant of the H3 jet max, deep-layer forcing of a warm-moist conveyor belt, Saturday night into Sunday morning. Clearing out into Sunday with the lake effect snow machine ongoing N/W. Could see some possible influences reaching N/W areas of MA and CT through Monday.  But the bigger story during this period is the WINDS. As mentioned above, strong SW response in advance of the storm. Potential for boundary layer lapse rates up to H9 to exceed 6 C/km, as warm air advection proceeds beneath a progged H9-7 dry inversion, through which winds are forecast to exceed 60 mph. Some uncertainty on the crux of the winds, however it would appear SE New England is under greatest threat of headlines out ahead of the sweeping cold front boundary. Signals within CIPS analogs and ensemble mean anomalies. Will hit upon potential headlines in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.  Behind the cold front, a strong isallobaric / gradient response continues along with cold air advection.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM THURSDAY MORNING/...  A scattered to broken deck of cloudiness this evening will trend towards overcast after midnight.  This a result of low pressure across the Great Lakes lifting northeast into southern Canada. Upper level ridging should still maintain dry weather for most of the night.  An increasing low level jet/forcing should allow for some showers to impact interior southern New England after 2 or 3 am. There is a low risk for a very brief period of light snow/ice at the onset across the highest terrain of northwest/north central MA, but even if this occurs should be very short-lived.  Low temps should occur by midnight generally in the upper 20s to middle 30s, but readings should slowly rise thereafter as clouds continue to increase.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM THURSDAY MORNING THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/...  ***A 1 to 3 hour period of heavy rain between noon and 5 pm on Thursday across central/eastern MA and RI with the low risk for localized damaging wind gusts near the south coast***  Thursday...  Scattered showers will be on going Thursday morning in the warm air advection pattern.  Attention will then turn to secondary low pressure that will develop off the south coast and rapidly intensity as it lifts northeast.  The greatest precipitation amounts look to occur in Maine given the storm is just starting its rapid intensification in our area.  However, some of our high resolution guidance has this occurring a bit faster than other models which is certainly possible given the setup.  If this occurs, it would bring a higher risk for brief heavy rainfall into our region.  There are two things that will have to watch for on Thursday. The first is a 1 to 3 hour period of heavy rain with the second being the low risk for convection/localized damaging wind gusts near the southeast New England coast.  A 1 to 3 hour heavy rain is expected between noon and 5 pm across central and eastern MA/RI. The heaviest rain may occur in two areas, the first being near and northwest of the I-95 corridor where very strong omega will be associated with the rapidly deepening low pressure system.  The second area may remain offshore or it may clip the southeast New England coast in association with the warm sector. If it does get onto the southeast New England coast, rapid pressure falls coupled with steep mid level lapse rates and some instability may result in a few embedded thunderstorms.  The pressure falls coupled with any convection may result in a low risk for localized damaging wind gusts near the southeast New England coast.  In fact, given the amount of low level helicity and cold temps aloft there is even a very low risk of a waterspout off the south coast.  All in all, odds favor this being the run of the mill nuisance event with a brief period of heavy rain and perhaps brief gusty winds along the southeast New England coast.  However, given the dynamics/pressure falls associated with this system that low risk for localized damaging wind gusts associated with possible convection does exist on the southeast New England coast.  Thursday night...  The low pressure system will continue to intensify as it lifts into downeast Maine and away from the region.  The result will be dry weather Thursday night other than perhaps a few rain/snow showers along the east slopes of the Berks.  The main story will be the increasing pressure gradient which should result in northwest wind gusts of 25 to 35 mph with perhaps a few gusts up to 40 mph.  Low temps will be mainly in the 30s, but it will feel colder given the gusty winds.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - Persistence of cooler than average air  - Wet weather forecast Saturday into Sunday  - Periods of gusty winds, potentially up to 45 mph  - Wind threats early Friday, and late Saturday through Monday  */ Overview...  Persistence of cooler than average air with shots of mild weather in- between. Individual zonal-flow disturbances over the CONUS this week bottle up over the N Atlantic by the weekend, increasing meridional flow, invoking a brief ridging-block across the Davis Straight as indicated by the -NAO. A digging storm system over the weekend with polar connections deepening into E Canada becomes trapped briefly, its remnant circulation a focus for additional energy out of the N/W to rotate through resulting in maintenance in addition to shots of Arctic air sweeping S into the NE CONUS. Meanwhile upstream, the N Pacific ridge maintains, downstream of which energy shears S gaining greater cyclonic curvature and deepening. Subsequent ridging over the W and Central CONUS only aids in the SE transport of colder air. While a return to zonal flow is entirely plausible going into the holiday weekend, the longer term ensemble mean trend suggests that troughing continues over the NW Pacific downstream of which the ridge- trough pattern follows out across an open Atlantic. Believe the cooler and active pattern will continue however without the allowance for deeper storm development into the NE CONUS. Mainly thinking continued quick moving disturbances. Will hit the details in the discussion below. A preference to the 15.12z EC and ensemble means (GEFS and ECens).  */ Discussion...  Friday...  Potential WIND ADVISORY headlines. Behind the deepening departing system into SE Canada, will see a H925 50-55 mph NW jet especially over E/SE New England, the height of which will be bright and early in the morning, diminishing into afternoon. Boundary layer lapse rates up to H9 around 6 C/km should promote the mix down of faster momentum to the surface. Using just a rule of thumb of 70 percent of the top of the mixed layer nets 40 mph. However believe there is the potential for gusts up around 45 mph during the morning before high pressure builds in from the W. Scattered to broken cloud decks that rotate across the region, especially E/NE, clear out towards the overnight period, winds diminishing. Radiational cooling proceeding into Saturday morning, leaning towards the lowest of guidance. Highs in the 40s during the days dropping down to lows in the 20s possibly as low as the teens into Saturday.  Saturday into Monday...  Potent storm system digging across the NE CONUS into E/SE Canada. A polar connection rearward as the system undergoes a negative tilt, obtaining greater cyclonic curvature, the thermal gradient tightens yielding a strong W/SW jet streak response in advance of the system at all levels Saturday night into Sunday. Looking at initial over- running rains as the warm front lifts N over the area late Saturday followed by the main slug out ahead of the primary vortmax and right- front-quadrant of the H3 jet max, deep-layer forcing of a warm-moist conveyor belt, Saturday night into Sunday morning. Clearing out into Sunday with the lake effect snow machine ongoing N/W. Could see some possible influences reaching N/W areas of MA and CT through Monday.  But the bigger story during this period is the WINDS. As mentioned above, strong SW response in advance of the storm. Potential for boundary layer lapse rates up to H9 to exceed 6 C/km, as warm air advection proceeds beneath a progged H9-7 dry inversion, through which winds are forecast to exceed 60 mph. Some uncertainty on the crux of the winds, however it would appear SE New England is under greatest threat of headlines out ahead of the sweeping cold front boundary. Signals within CIPS analogs and ensemble mean anomalies. Will hit upon potential headlines in the HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.  Behind the cold front, a strong isallobaric / gradient response continues along with cold air advection. Lapse rates nearly dry adiabatic through which NW winds of 45 to 50 mph are forecast, brought about by additional energy rotating through the region, a local enhancement to the flow. Again, the 70 percent rule of thumb, gusts up around 35 mph, but can`t rule out 40 to 45 mph gusts ever briefly through the day. Threat for both Sunday and Monday, will see winds relax Monday night.

Precip may break out between 09z-12z especially across western-central MA into CT. If precip arrives a bit earlier it may begin as a brief period of snow and/or sleet in western/northern MA. Otherwise ptype will be rain. Dry weather may linger until sunrise Thu across RI and eastern MA, with rain possibly arriving after sunrise Thu here.  Thursday...

Thus the brunt of this storm will be felt northeast of our region, across NH and ME. However there will be at least some impacts here as comma head develops over southern New England. All model guid suggest a period of moderate to heavy rain in the comma- head across interior CT-MA Thu afternoon. Mid level lapse rates approach 7C/KM as comma-head develops. Thus have inserted chance of elevated convection. This may yield a period of heavy rainfall with a low risk of minor poor drainage/street-highway flooding. Other concern will be developing low level S-SE jet in the prefrontal environment.

General fast H5 steering flow across the northern hemisphere continues into early next week. Noting one system that pushes N of New England this weekend which tries to develop cutoff H5 low pressure, but not seeing any blocking features in this pattern. Also noting fluctuating temp trends, with cold air insurgence as low pressure centers move east of the region, followed by return to near or a bit above normal temps as next system in the flow approaches.  Overall, used blend of available guidance to develop long term forecast. However, timing issues ensued amongst the 00Z model suite, with the GFS tending to be a fast outlier with the weekend system. Used a non-GFS blend for this system. Otherwise, went with overall blend of model guidance with some tweaking for timing.  Details...  Thursday night-Friday...  As primary low pres moves into Quebec, a secondary low forms across the region late Thu, but pushes quickly NE into the Gulf of Maine Thu night into Fri. Noting good instability moves across early Thu night, so kept mention of chance thunder in the forecast, mainly across E Mass mainly near and N of the Mass Pike until about midnight. As colder air wraps in behind the system, will see some light snow showers develop mainly across the E slopes of the Berkshires before ending by around midnight.  Noting strong cyclogenesis as the low moves into Mass Bay and the Gulf of Maine overnight into Friday. Strong low level NW jet also moves across, so will see gusty W-NW winds develop after 06Z or so especially along the coast. On Friday, expect gusts up to 30-35 kt along the shore, possibly up to 40 kt across the outer Cape and Nantucket. Colder air moves in, so highs will only reach the upper 30s across the higher inland terrain, ranging to the lower-mid 50s across the coastal plain.  Will need to monitor for possible wind advisories across portions of Cape Cod and the islands late Thu night into Fri morning.  Saturday-Sunday...  N-S longitudinal high pressure progresses eastward with fast flow aloft. As the high breaks down across the region, the next low will head NE bringing another area of showers as milder air works in with increasing S-SW winds. The low deepens as it moves NE into Quebec by Sat night, so will see gusty SW winds along the S coast. Expect the cold front to move across the region late Sat night into Sun morning as winds shift to W. Gusty winds will develop after midnight Sat night into mid morning Sunday as the front moves through especially near the coast.  Expect drier conditions to quickly move across by midday Sunday with gusts up to 25-30 kt along the S coast, Cape Cod and the islands, and 20-25 kt elsewhere. Expect temps close to seasonal normals both Sat and Sun.  Monday-Tuesday...  Expect dry conditions and chilly temps on Monday as high pressure settles across SE U.S. Cold NW winds remain in place most of the day, so expect highs to run around 10 degrees below seasonal normals.  The northern portion of the ridge will break down as a weak front works across southern Canada on Tuesday, though winds become SW so it will be a milder day with highs close to normal for late November.",

Thus only change to previous forecast was to delay this clearing trend until after midnight. Otherwise forecast is on track. Earlier discussion below.  ====================================================================  Previous discussion...  Upper level low and cold pool are centered over N New England with -26C isotherm clipping N MA. This low will move off through the maritimes by morning, and as a consequence temperatures aloft will warm by several degrees.  High pressure surface and aloft will build in overnight. Moisture levels diminish after 06z, suggesting a clearing trend in the sky cover after midnight. Winds will be light in the interior. Even on Cape Cod/islands where winds remain brisk this evening, expect the winds to diminish overnight.  With clearing conditions and light wind, expect temperatures in W MA and CT to radiate for a few hours and reach near the dew point. Farther east where clouds persist longer, temps will remain a few degrees above dew point. Overall range should be mid 20s northwest to near 40 Nantucket.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM WEDNESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Wednesday...  High pressure overhead will bring mainly clear skies and light wind.

This supports max sfc temps in the low to mid 40s.  Some question remains as to lingering clouds over the Cape and Islands. RH fields at 925 mb show 90-95 pct values there during Wednesday while 850 mb RH values are high mainly to the east of the Outer Cape.

Maturation occurring downstream as the system obtains cyclonic curvature drawing S Arctic energy rearward subsequently deepening with the tightening thermal wind / baroclinic zone.

Need to watch closely as to whether some of the initial light precipitation is of a wintry mix before changing to rain during the day with S draw of sub-tropical air. Low risk given the overnight airmass lacking an Arctic connection.  Flow reverting S quickly, highs and surface dewpoints becoming mild. The system sliding and immediately departing, it begins to close off and stack. Could see a departing slug of precipitation and breezy W winds as the secondary low deepens NE into SE Canada, trowaling of the warm conveyor belt emerging, deformation focusing in the NE-quad of the H85-7 low. Magnitude and positioning crucial with respect to cooling towards the wet-bulb, potentially drawing S air below H925 right around freezing given the absence of an Arctic connection. The 14.12z EC seemingly the outlier with respect to position / strength of the surface low, however the 14.12z NAM not far off. Will keep with a cold rain this forecast thinking the flow would be more E and progressive even with the secondary low circulation and mid-upper level features, less opportunity for maturation and surface low backing / retrograding beneath lower heights.  Drier air quickly wrapping, precipitation quickly comes to an end overnight and cold air advection proceeds, steepening low level lapse rates, keeping those breezy winds into Friday morning.

Temps will bottom out in the 30s well inland to around 40 or so at the shoreline early Wed night, then will slowly increase during the early morning hours with the milder air starting to work in ahead of the cold front.

Also noting strong low level NW jet moving across, with H85 winds up to 30-40 kt, but some question how much this will mix down. Appears that low level mixing develops during Fri afternoon, but from about H9 and lower. Could see gusts up to around 20 kt, highest across the inland terrain, but will be blustery along the coast especially Cape Cod and the islands.  With mostly sunny to sunny skies on Friday, temps will only top off in the mid-upper 30s across the higher terrain ranging to the lower to mid 40s across the coastal plain.  Friday night-Saturday night...  Ridge axis at the surface and aloft shifts E. Expect increasing clouds during Fri night, but timing is in question. Noting widening model solution spread in the progression of the next system toward the region. GFS appears to be fast outlier in bring in leading edge of precip ahead of next cold front sometime Saturday, while GGEM and ECMWF is slower in moving low pressure out of the eastern Great Lakes around or after 00Z Sun. This is mainly due to both the GGEM and ECMWF trying to develop H5 cutoff low pres across southern Quebec/eastern Great Lakes while digging the mid level trough S to the Carolinas. 00Z GFS remains progressive.  Could see leading edge of precip move into western areas after 06Z Sat, with best chance for precip during Sat, even though the surface low pres is slow to exit the eastern Great Lakes due to the possible mid level cutoff low.  With temps running in the lower-mid 30s well inland late Fri night, might see some snow showers at the onset of any precip that may reach into N central and W Mass mainly across the higher terrain. Little if any snow accumulation is expected. Most precip should hold off until the daylight hours Sat as temps rebound to the 40s well inland ranging to the mid 50s along the S coast.  Sunday-Monday...  The slower model members hold off bringing the cold front through until Sunday morning. Scattered showers may linger into midday Sunday, and may mix with some snow showers across the E slopes of the Berkshires before ending around midday Sunday.

    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM MONDAY/... Overnight... The very weak initial wave moving through today will shift E along with high pres and allow for slight enhancement of low lvl ridging. This ridging remains dirty however, as moisture continues to spill from W-E in the mid and lower lvls through the overnight hours. Aside from a continued risk for occasional drizzle with initially dry air aloft, mainly dry conditions are expected overnight thanks to this extra ridging. The increased clouds and slight low-mid lvl warming will lead to a mild evening. However, high pres shifting into the Maritimes, with inverted ridging to the N will allow winds to shift to the N-NE with some modest cold air drainage. Still not as cold as previous nights, but how cold/deep the cool layer is able to get will define precip during the day on Mon.

A combination of some mid-high clouds (column moisture loads mainly above H6) and high pres shifting just E along for ever-so-modest low-mid lvl warming have limited the inversion development. While MOS temps suggested many locations should be in the teens and even single digits, most locations rest comfortably in the 20s, and have been for some time. Moisture has even responded near the sfc, as dwpts generally remain in the teens as well.  Given the fact that MOS has not been very good of late, have leaned more heavily on raw 2m temps this morning and today. The warmer start than previously thought, combined with slight warming under return flow and thin CI/mid clouds should allow temps to rise comfortably into the 40s across much of the region late this morning, in spite of the suppressed BL mixing under influence of 1030+ hPa high pres sliding E.  One fly in the ointment today, outside of the clouds, is as return flow develops the remnant moisture from offshore ocean effect to the S will become trapped beneath the subsidence inversion and begin to shift to the N. This could bring more abundant lower clouds, and with a dry-over-moist sounding, some light sprinkles or drizzle at times with a focus along SE coastal MA and RI.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...  *** Record Cold Tonight Outside The Urban Areas ***  10pm update... Although initial radiational cooling through the evening was showing its typical curve, it has since asymptotally slowed across much of the region, and this is not just per the ASOS data strictly, but several of the mesowest sites as well. Am noting that high-mid deck continues to stream in from the W, and that the actual high pres crest is already sliding to the E allowing for ever so slight warming/increasing moisture. These may actually limit the radiational cooling somewhat. Even the most reacent colder MOS values, usually led by the MAV are a bit warmer this round. Therefore, have raised overnight mins a bit compared to previous runs but with some deference to the former forecast as it would not take much of a shift to allow a rapid drop during the early morning hours. Otherwise, forecast is generally on track.  Previous discussion follows...  A ridge of high pressure overhead coupled with an anomalously cold airmass in place will result in record cold temps tonight outside the urban areas. Temps early this evening have already dropped into the 20s in many locations with the light winds/extremely dry airmass in place. There will be a band of mid/high level cloudiness that moves across the region tonight, but probably remains thin enough that it will not have much of an impact on temperatures.  Given the conditions above followed the coldest MAV guidance, where the normally coldest outlying locations should see mins in the 5 to 10 above zero range by daybreak Sunday! Elsewhere most locations fall into the teens with 20s for Boston, Outer Cape Cod and Nantucket. Expecting BDL smash the record low of 20 tonight set in 1976 & 1957, as we`re forecasting a low of 12F! PVD has a chance too with its record low of 21 set in 1926 and a forecast low of 19.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/... Updated 340 PM...  Sunday...  Very cold start to the day with 1034 mb high over the region. Not much of a temp recover either as strong surface ridge remains in place and precludes shallow cold layer from completely mixing out. Wildcard here is low level moisture currently in the form of ocean effect strato-cu remains trapped beneath subsidence inversion and then begins to advect onshore in return flow tomorrow as core of the high moves offshore. Both NAM and GFS low level RH fields show these low clouds coming onshore into RI and southeast MA during the morning and afternoon, possibly northward into the Greater Boston area. In fact some of the guidance including the 12z EC, Rgem, ARW, NMMB have light spotty drizzle/light rain with this low level moisture coming onshore. Not a washout but will include some spotty light drizzle/rain across RI and eastern MA.  So regarding temps, the combination of shallow cold air, limited blyr mixing due to subsidence inversion, low Nov sun angle and potential BKN-OVC strato-cu clouds, temps may remain in the 30s across interior RI and southeast MA. We blended some of the colder guidance and came up with highs in the low 40s, MU40s Cape Cod and islands with developing southeast winds with near shore water temps in the low 50s.  Overall not a typical mid Nov day with colder than normal temps along with some light spotty light rain/drizzle.  Sun night...  Could be some light spotty rain around the region with abundant low level moisture trapped beneath the subsidence inversion. However mainly dry weather prevails as short wave ridging develops across the area as one short wave exits Maine late Sun followed by a more robust short wave approaching from the west.  Not as cold as previous nights given cloud cover but still chilly given trapped shallow cold air especially away from the coastline. Lows in the 30s, low 40s south coast including Cape Cod and Islands.",

Highlights...  * A few showers with even high terrain wet snow flakes possible Mon * Another round of brief showers poss Wed night/Thu am * A period of widespread showers likely late Fri and/or Sat * Below normal temps much of next week  Details...  Monday...  A shortwave will cross the region on Monday bringing the risk for a a few showers.  The shortwave is progressive and the forcing may be somewhat limited given the lack of a low level jet/deeper moisture. Therefore, the duration/areal coverage of any showers may be limited. It may be cold enough for some wet snow flakes across the high terrain. The NAM is more aggressive than the other models with the forcing/moisture. While it is probably too robust, if verified a small/slushy accumulation of snow would be possible across the interior high terrain.  This looks like a low probability right now but something that is too early to completely rule out.  Temps will likely be quite cool on Mon with low clouds and northeast winds. Highs across the coastal plain should reach into the 40s, but would not be surprised if portions of the interior do not break 40.  Monday night and Tuesday...  High pressure over eastern Canada will generate light northeast flow, although it will be a bit breezy across the Cape/Islands. Given the northeast flow may be dealing with a considerable amount of cloudiness persisting into Tue. While dry weather should dominate, can not rule out a spot shower or two especially Mon night/Tue am with moist low level flow.  High temps will probably be held in the 40s on Tue.  Wednesday and Thursday...  Mainly dry and cool weather continues on Wednesday with high pressure in control.  High temps will mainly be in the 40s on Wed. A cold front may bring another brief band of scattered showers sometime late Wed into early Thu based on current models, but appears to be far from a washout with limited moisture/forcing.  Friday and Saturday...  Strong shortwave/digging trough across the Great Lakes may induce a decent southerly low level jet into southern New England.  While plenty of uncertainty given this is a 6-7 day forecast, a period of widespread showers seems likely late Friday and/or Saturday with a decent low level jet/forcing.  At this time, looks like will be on the warm side of the system so unless there is a significant change in the model guidance mainly looking at a liquid event.

Otherwise, dry weather dominates with the next real shot of widespread showers sometime late Friday and/or Saturday.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...  340 PM update...  *** Record Cold Tonight Outside The Urban Areas ***  Modified arctic airmass over the region late this afternoon with dew pts in the single digits and air temps only in the 30s. Normal high for 11/11 is 50-55F, thus about 20 degs colder than normal! SPC mesoanalysis and surface observations indicate ridge of high pres stretching from southern Quebec southward thru NY state, eastern PA into DCA area. This cold ridge will advect across New England overnight provide ideal radiational cooling conditions with mostly clear skies, light winds and extremely dry airmass. Given these conditions followed the colder MAV guidance and even shaved a few more degs off in the typically colder locations of the CT river valley and the I-495 corridor of eastern MA, where mins will dip into the single digits! Elsewhere most locations fall into the teens with 20s for Boston, Outer Cape Cod and Nantucket. Expecting BDL smash the record low of 20 tonight set in 1976 & 1957, as we`re forecasting a low of 10F! PVD has a chance too with its record low of 21 set in 1926 and a forecast low of 20.  As NNW winds slacken strato-cu ocean effect clouds over the outer Cape and Nantucket will move offshore. While cirrus clouds will overspread the region overnight, expecting these clouds to remain thin enough not to impact temps from falling. In fact temps will fall rapidly with sunset.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/... Updated 340 PM...  Sunday...  Very cold start to the day with 1034 mb high over the region. Not much of a temp recover either as strong surface ridge remains in place and precludes shallow cold layer from completely mixing out. Wildcard here is low level moisture currently in the form of ocean effect strato-cu remains trapped beneath subsidence inversion and then begins to advect onshore in return flow tomorrow as core of the high moves offshore. Both NAM and GFS low level RH fields show these low clouds coming onshore into RI and southeast MA during the morning and afternoon, possibly northward into the Greater Boston area. In fact some of the guidance including the 12z EC, Rgem, ARW, NMMB have light spotty drizzle/light rain with this low level moisture coming onshore. Not a washout but will include some spotty light drizzle/rain across RI and eastern MA.  So regarding temps, the combination of shallow cold air, limited blyr mixing due to subsidence inversion, low Nov sun angle and potential BKN-OVC strato-cu clouds, temps may remain in the 30s across interior RI and southeast MA. We blended some of the colder guidance and came up with highs in the low 40s, MU40s Cape Cod and islands with developing southeast winds with near shore water temps in the low 50s.  Overall not a typical mid Nov day with colder than normal temps along with some light spotty light rain/drizzle.  Sun night...  Could be some light spotty rain around the region with abundant low level moisture trapped beneath the subsidence inversion. However mainly dry weather prevails as short wave ridging develops across the area as one short wave exits Maine late Sun followed by a more robust short wave approaching from the west.  Not as cold as previous nights given cloud cover but still chilly given trapped shallow cold air especially away from the coastline. Lows in the 30s, low 40s south coast including Cape Cod and Islands.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...  Highlights...  * A few showers with even high terrain wet snow flakes possible Mon * Another round of brief showers poss Wed night/Thu but not a washout * A period of widespread showers likely late Fri and/or Sat * Below normal temps much of next week  Details...  Monday...  A shortwave will cross the region on Monday bringing the risk for a a few showers.  The shortwave is progressive and the forcing may be somewhat limited given the lack of a low level jet/deeper moisture. Therefore, the duration/areal coverage of any showers may be limited. It may be cold enough for some wet snow flakes across the high terrain. The NAM is more aggressive than the other models with the forcing/moisture. While it is probably too robust, if verified a small/slushy accumulation of snow would be possible across the interior high terrain.  This looks like a low probability right now but something that is too early to completely rule out.  Temps will likely be quite cool on Mon with low clouds and northeast winds. Highs across the coastal plain should reach into the 40s, but would not be surprised if portions of the interior do not break 40.  Monday night and Tuesday...  High pressure over eastern Canada will generate light northeast flow, although it will be a bit breezy across the Cape/Islands. Given the northeast flow may be dealing with a considerable amount of cloudiness persisting into Tue. While dry weather should dominate, can not rule out a spot shower or two especially Mon night/Tue am with moist low level flow.  High temps will probably be held in the 40s on Tue.  Wednesday and Thursday...  Mainly dry and cool weather continues on Wednesday with high pressure in control.  High temps will mainly be in the 40s on Wed. A cold front may bring another brief band of scattered showers sometime late Wed into early Thu based on current models, but appears to be far from a washout with limited moisture/forcing.  Friday and Saturday...  Strong shortwave/digging trough across the Great Lakes may induce a decent southerly low level jet into southern New England.  While plenty of uncertainty given this is a 6-7 day forecast, a period of widespread showers seems likely late Friday and/or Saturday with a decent low level jet/forcing.  At this time, looks like will be on the warm side of the system so unless there is a significant change in the model guidance mainly looking at a liquid event.  Perhaps a period of gusty winds ahead of and behind this system.",

So the combination of diminishing winds and full sunshine will yield conditions not as cold as yesterday, despite highs only in the 30s (normal high 50-55!).  The exception will be over the outer Cape and Nantucket as cold NNW flow streaming across the relatively warm near shore waters will result in ocean effect clouds from time to time.

Progressive pattern is noted across the CONUS with series of shortwaves traversing across the northern CONUS and southern Canada which originate from active NE Pacific trough. Typical subtle differences with individual shortwaves at these longer term time ranges but not expected to have much impact on sensible weather. Temps below normal through much of the period.  Sunday night into Monday night...  Mid level trough approaches from the Ohio valley and moves south of New Eng by late Mon. Coastal low pres forecast to remain well offshore but models all indicate an inverted trough extending north toward SNE in response to the mid level shortwave. NAM/GGEM are most aggressive with this feature and develop a sfc low south of New Eng in response to a sharper mid level trough, although there are some timing differences. This results in heavier rain developing near the coast sometime Mon/Mon evening with precip extending north across all SNE which thermal profiles suggest would be in the form of snow in part of the interior. GFS/ECMWF/UKMET are considerably weaker and drier with light QPF, focused across SE New Eng.

This led to a slight rise in overnight min temps until we can see whether some decoupling can occur late. Otherwise, forecast remains on track  Previous discussion...  As H5 cutoff low/associated surface low push NE out of the Maritimes tonight, pressure gradient relaxes. Noting another H85 jet passing across at around 00Z, up to around 40 kt. Some of the higher lapse rates, around 7-9C/km fm H95-H9 linger through 03Z across the waters and the higher inland terrain, with 25-30 kt jets from H925 to H95. Also noting lower winds at the base of the 12Z NAM and GFS BUFKIT soundings by 02Z at the latest. Since winds are already diminishing, have ended the wind advisory.  Winds up to 15-20 kt will likely linger across E coastal areas, and a bit lower across the interior tonight as high pressure moves slowly into W NY/W PA and S Ontario. Coldest air arrives in the NW wind flow at the surface and aloft, with H85 temps on order of -10C to -15C by around 00Z Sat but may not stick around overnight. However, with the lighter winds, will probably see some decent radiational cooling especially across the inland valleys.  Expect temps to drop as skies remain mainly clear overnight. Away from the immediate coast, will see readings plummet to the single digits and teens inland and in the normally colder valleys, down to the 20s along the immediate coast. With the cold air in place, no doubt about freezing temps across Newport county RI as well as Cape Cod and the islands. Kept freeze warning going.  Looks like best shot for a record low will be in Boston tonight, but can`t rule out the other three (KBDL, KORH and KPVD).

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... Big Picture...  Pattern shows a semi-permanent upper low over the Canadian Arctic and high pressure parked over Mexico. The flow in between is near- zonal across the Northern USA. Several shortwaves are forecast to move through the flow. These cross New England on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. A fourth shortwave, the deepest of the set, moves to the Great Lakes by Friday.  There is good agreement among the GFS/ECMWF/GGEM mass and thermal fields through at least Wednesday, with some divergence among solutions Thursday and Friday. Height contours within the zonal flow are near normal to a little cooler than normal.  Overall, forecast confidence is moderate-high, with the main uncertainty resulting from timing shortwaves in a zonal flow. The timing cited above may change in future runs of the models.  Details...  Sunday-Monday...  High pressure over the region will bring dry weather for Sunday, with light winds at the start and winds turning from the southeast during the afternoon/evening. Moisture fields show some increase in mid and high clouds during the afternoon/evening. Mixing levels should reach between 900 and 925 mb, where temps would support max sfc temps in the low to mid 40s.  Upper trough approaches Sunday night and passes through on Monday. Positioning of the associated upper jet is to our south and suggests the best chance of precipitation remains offshore. But upper divergence fields show a fair amount of upper venting across Southern New England. This may generate/support either an offshore low. This in turn would favor some lift, so expect a chance of showers mostly across parts of CT/RI/Eastern Mass. Temperatures aloft are cold enough for snow for part of the day over Western and Central Mass and northern parts of CT. But the lingering question is whether the showers reach that far or if they do so during the favorable part of the day for snow showers.  The system moves well offshore Monday night.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SATURDAY MORNING/...  Best low level mixing will continue to head E out of the region through the remainder of the day. Have had some wind gusts close to criteria, up to 39 kt at KBAF at 18Z, along with several wind damage reports.  As H5 cutoff low/associated surface low push NE out of the Maritimes tonight, pressure gradient relaxes. Noting another H85 jet passing across at around 00Z, up to around 40 kt. Some of the higher lapse rates, around 7-9C/km fm H95-H9 linger through 03Z across the waters and the higher inland terrain, with 25-30 kt jets from H925 to H95. Also noting lower winds at the base of the 12Z NAM and GFS BUFKIT soundings by 02Z at the latest. Since winds are already diminishing, have ended the wind advisory.  Winds up to 15-20 kt will likely linger across E coastal areas, and a bit lower across the interior tonight as high pressure moves slowly into W NY/W PA and S Ontario. Coldest air arrives in the NW wind flow at the surface and aloft, with H85 temps on order of -10C to -15C by around 00Z Sat but may not stick around overnight. However, with the lighter winds, will probably see some decent radiational cooling especially across the inland valleys.  Expect temps to drop as skies remain mainly clear overnight. Away from the immediate coast, will see readings plummet to the single digits and teens inland and in the normally colder valleys, down to the 20s along the immediate coast. With the cold air in place, no doubt about freezing temps across Newport county RI as well as Cape Cod and the islands. Kept freeze warning going.  Looks like best shot for a record low will be in Boston tonight, but can`t rule out the other three (KBDL, KORH and KPVD). Will also see rather low wind chill values especially across the colder inland valleys and single digits at most other locales except along the immediate coast. Rather low for mid November.",

Center of large high pressure slowly pushes E across the region Saturday afternoon and night. Winds slowly veer from NW to N during Sat, then light/variable or calm Sat night as the high builds across the region. Will see mainly sunny skies Saturday, though some high clouds may linger across Cape Cod and the islands. Cold air remains across the region, so highs will not be that warm. May see highs remaining below freezing across portions of the higher inland terrain. Depending upon the temp recovery during short daylight, may some of our long term climate sites remain below their lowest max temp records for November 11.  With the light or calm winds Saturday night, will likely see best radiational cooling with the long night and mainly clear skies. Only fly in the ointment will be whether band of mid clouds moves across the region. The clouds may be thin enough to allow for radiational cooling, however. May still see a few of the long term climate sites tie or set record lows for Sun 11/12. See list of record lows and low max temps for both Saturday and Sunday in the Climate section below.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... Big Picture...  Pattern shows a semi-permanent upper low over the Canadian Arctic and high pressure parked over Mexico. The flow in between is near- zonal across the Northern USA. Several shortwaves are forecast to move through the flow. These cross New England on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. A fourth shortwave, the deepest of the set, moves to the Great Lakes by Friday.  There is good agreement among the GFS/ECMWF/GGEM mass and thermal fields through at least Wednesday, with some divergence among solutions Thursday and Friday. Height contours within the zonal flow are near normal to a little cooler than normal.  Overall, forecast confidence is moderate-high, with the main uncertainty resulting from timing shortwaves in a zonal flow. The timing cited above may change in future runs of the models.  Details...  Sunday-Monday...  High pressure over the region will bring dry weather for Sunday, with light winds at the start and winds turning from the southeast during the afternoon/evening. Moisture fields show some increase in mid and high clouds during the afternoon/evening. Mixing levels should reach between 900 and 925 mb, where temps would support max sfc temps in the low to mid 40s.  Upper trough approaches Sunday night and passes through on Monday. Positioning of the associated upper jet is to our south and suggests the best chance of precipitation remains offshore. But upper divergence fields show a fair amount of upper venting across Southern New England. This may generate/support either an offshore low. This in turn would favor some lift, so expect a chance of showers mostly across parts of CT/RI/Eastern Mass. Temperatures aloft are cold enough for snow for part of the day over Western and Central Mass and northern parts of CT. But the lingering question is whether the showers reach that far or if they do so during the favorable part of the day for snow showers.  The system moves well offshore Monday night.  Tuesday through Friday...  High pressure builds across the region Tuesday and Wednesday. A second upper trough moves across on Tuesday and may hold on to a period of cloud cover during the day.  Otherwise expect dry weather.  Another shortwave is forecast to move through late Wednesday night and Thursday morning, bringing another period of clouds and possible showers.

Excellent low level mixing also continues with gusts up to 35-38 kt across portions of central and western Mass.

Mainly clear skies, though noting a few snow showers across portions of the Berkshires and into S central NH. Could see a few brief snow showers mainly across the Route 2 area of N Mass and the E slopes of the Berkshires as lake effect snow bands cross NY state. Will not see much, however, as dewpoints have fallen to the teens and lower 20s across the region with the gusty winds.  Have updated near term forecast to bring conditions current and incorporated into the afternoon forecast.  Previous Discussion...  Gusts through the day will likely remain below wind advisory criteria. Will continue the advisory with the gusts as well as some enhanced tree damage in spite of the weaker values.  High temps have already occurred, with the front moving through over the next few hours, strong CAA will easily counteract diurnal heating in spite of mixing all the way to above H85. Temps at this lvl drop to -15C to -17C by late day. Therefore, expect gradual reduction in temps through the daylight hours.

An SPS will be issued to cover this risk, especially given the abnormally warm fall thus far. Freeze warnings remain in effect given the cold temps in areas where growing season continues.  Tomorrow... Early start combined with the crest of strong (1035+ hPa) high pres will limit mixing to about H92, which do warm to about -4C by late day.

Have been monitoring wind gusts with the fropa when stronger across NY state, and the bulk of the gusts have fallen between 35-40 kt with the front`s arrival, so have adjusted early AM wind gusts toward this magnitude. Pre-frontal SHRA moving across E MA should be offshore over the next hour as dry air quickly moves in from the W. Meanwhile the precip line associated with the front continues to dissipate as stronger dynamics shift into central and N New England. Will maintain a few chance POPs in the E slopes of the Berkshires thanks to early morning upslope component.  Otherwise, the big shift overnight has been to weaken the expected LLJ through the day. Instead of consistently 40-45 kt at H85, its now mainly 35-40 kt. The CAA this morning suggests mixing through the day should tap H85 or even slightly higher, with a peak in the LLJ this morning, therefore will peak wind gusts between 12Z-15Z this morning then gradually reduce them through the afternoon, this is supported by weakening isallobaricflow with a reduction in pres rises through the afternoon.

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM FRIDAY MORNING/... 10pm update... MSAS/OBs suggest cold front still W of SYR this evening, and continuing a quick swing to the the E. The area of main SHRA/SHSN associated with the front continues to show more of a ENE shift as stronger dynamics shift into Canada and N New England. Still, continued development of pre-frontal SHRA across E NY should slide into region over the next few hours under modest warm advection and moisture flux ahead of the front. BL/wet-bulb temps look too warm for snow in spite of feeling quite cool, best chance would be any ana-frontal snow showers with a focus mainly in the higher terrain such as the Berkshires. POPs were timed closest to latest meso-scale guidance with temps/dwpts adjusted via MOS. Otherwise, forecast continue to holds at this point.  Previous discussion follows...  Mid and high level clouds continue to stream across the region ahead of approaching arctic front out of the eastern Great Lakes late this afternoon, as seen on GOES-16 (prelim, non-op) and GOES-15 visible satellite imagery. Noting some spotty showers that have developed across N NJ and off the Delmarva coast at 20Z, then seeing a few showers over Lakes Ontario and Erie likely ahead of the front. Will remain dry through the remainder of the afternoon.  Winds shift to S-SW tonight as digging H5 short wave pushes steadily E overnight, while H5 cutoff low develops over southern Quebec but remains progressive. Most of the energy and moisture associated with the system remains well N of the region. However, the majority of the 12Z model suite members holds on to a band of moisture near or just ahead of the front, so can not rule out a few rain showers, that may mix with or change to snow showers over N central and W Mass as the front moves across overnight.  The pressure gradient tightens as the front passes, with winds quickly shifting to W-NW. Noting strong low and mid level jet, with winds up to 30-45 kt up to H85, along with excellent mixing with low level lapse rates of 9-10C/km moving across after midnight. So, will see wind gusts increase to 25-35 kt by around 08Z or so, highest across the higher terrain and along the coast especially toward daybreak.  Temps will bottom out in the lower-mid 20s well inland ranging to 35-40 at the coast.",

Large high pressure builds E out of the upper Plains states and Great Lakes during this timeframe.

W-NW wind gusts up to 30 to around 40 mph through early afternoon then will slowly diminish through the remainder of the day. Skies will be mostly clear through the day, but it will feature windy and cold conditions. Not much temp recovery on Friday, with highs expected early in the morning then will fall throughout the remainder of the day. Wind chill values will range from the single digits and teens across the higher terrain to the 20s across the coastal plain.  Expect clear skies with slowly diminishing winds Friday night.

Expect temps bottoming out in the single digits and teens away from the coast to the mid teens and 20s along the immediate coast. These readings are more typical of mid winter rather than late fall.

Highlights...  * Near Record Cold Sat morning into Sunday morning * Not as cold Sunday afternoon * A coastal storm may impact the region Sun ngt into early Tue   with wet snow high terrain, rain elsewhere but low confidence   on details  Saturday...  *** Near Record Breaking Cold Saturday Morning ***  After near record breaking cold Sat morning the core of the cold airmass begins to move offshore Sat afternoon. However 1035 mb high pres moving into the region provides a sharp subsidence inversion and limits blyr mixing to about 900 mb per BUFKIT model soundings. This will only allow temps to recover Sat afternoon to about 35-40 degs. Normal high for this time of year is 51-56. However much less wind than Fri so wind chills not as bitterly cold. However NW winds 15-20 mph with a few morning gusts up to 25 mph are possible, but the trend will be downward into the afternoon. Lots of morning sunshine will give way to increasing mid and high clouds during the afternoon streaming across the area from west to east.  Sunday...  *** Near Record Breaking Cold Outside Urban Areas Sat Night ***  1032 mb high settles over the region providing ideal radiational cooling conditions (mostly clear skies, light winds and very dry airmass). The urban areas will not be as cold as Fri night/Sat morning, but the valleys and away from the coastline will approach near record lows. See below for specific records. The one caveat is there will be some mid/high clouds around Sat night that could impact min temps but model RH time and height sections suggest clouds may be thin enough for little impact on temps.  Afternoon...  Airmass modifies with 925 mb temps warming from -6C Sat afternoon to -2C Sunday afternoon. Thus not as cold as Sat with highs Sun aftn in the 40s. If will feel milder given light winds with 1032 mb surface high just beginning to slide offshore. Morning sunshine will fade behind increasing clouds in response to developing WAA pattern.  Sunday night thru Tuesday...  Potential coastal low may impact the region this period. Lots of uncertainty with models struggling on the amplitude of lead and trailing short wave energy including separation between both of these features. This is resulting in different solutions, specifically the strength and timing of coastal development. New 12z EC and 12z UKMET have backed off their stronger and closer 00z solutions. Tracing this jet energy back all the way to off the Pacific Northwest coast this afternoon. Hopefully we will see better model consensus as this jet energy comes onshore into a more data rich area the next day or two. A weaker coastal low could also be problematic as cold antecedent conditions leftover from the arctic airmass Fri/Sat linger across the region Sun ngt into early next week. Nearly stationary 1030+ mb high over southeast Canada will help keep cold air entrenched across the interior. Although airmass is marginally cold enough to support snow especially in the blyr. Nonetheless will have to watch this closely for potential wet snow high terrain of northern MA Sun ngt into Tue morning. Elsewhere ptype should be a chilly rain with gusty winds possible southeast MA pending strength of coastal low and attending low level jet.  Wed/Thu...

    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  955 AM Update...  Skies have become mainly clear across the region except for some lingering clouds across S coastal areas and portions of the upper CT valley as seen on latest GOES-16 (prelim, non-op) visible satellite imagery. A few leftover patches of fog along the N central Mass border will dissipate by midday.  After a very chilly start, temps have rebounded to the mid 30s across the central and northern CT valley ranging to the lower 50s along the outer Cape and Nantucket.  Near term forecast pretty much on track. Have updated to bring conditions current and incorporated trends into this afternoon`s forecast.  Previous Discussion...  Will see plenty of sunshine to start the morning until modest moisture loading through the sounding occurs during the day under the development of return flow. This will allow for increasing clouds through the day ahead of a cold front as well as secondary low pres development S of the Delmarva late. Temps today still seasonably cool, mainly in the 40s thanks to H92 temps topping out around +2C. Otherwise, a generally quiet day as weak ridging/high pres shifts E.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM FRIDAY/... Tonight... Deepening and sharpening upper lvl wave with attendant strong cold front will approach late this evening and cross during the early overnight hours, clearing the region by early AM on Fri. Do agree with previous forecaster, that strongest PVA/low-mid lvl baroclinicity is to the N, mainly across central/N New England and Canada. However, noting a modest increase in low lvl moisture per latest bufkit soundings, which combined with even moderate f-gen with the frontal passage should yield some showery precip to develop through the evening hours, mainly through about midnight local. Will continue to highlight low chance POPs with this frontal passage in spite over the overall lack of moisture. Pre-front, the increase in low lvl moisture will yield sfc dwpts in the mid 30s to near 40, with wet-bulb temps generally above 0C through about 50-100mb above the sfc. Therefore, expecting mainly a cool SHRA initially. On the back side, any ana-frontal showers could transition as strong cold advection develops yielding a quick sfc instability burst, but qpf would be light, suggesting accums would be light as well. The best chance for accumulating precip will be mainly in the E slopes of the Berkshires, where a slight upslope component out of the W behind the front could allow for some early AM SHSN.  Winds behind the front will also increase rapidly through the early morning hours. THe strong cold advection will allow for mixing of at least a percentage of the 40-45 kt LLJ at H85. Rapid wind shifts/strong gusts could occur with the actual frontal passage, while gusts settle back to just below wind advisory across the region, but still blustery. The only caveat is the higher terrain, particularly the Berkshires as mixing will be maximized here. Will be issuing a wind advisory for the E slopes late tonight into Fri morning. Later shifts may need to monitor for a possible expansion. Overnight mins drop into the 30s, but late, mainly in the early AM hours following the front.  Fri... Strong nearly 1040hPa high pres noses in from the Great Lakes following the frontal passage. Cold advection continues most of the day and will likely counteract diurnal warming. Non-diurnal temp trend expected, with highs possibly occurring early, or with nearly stationary temps through the day, holding in the upper 20s to upper 30s most of S New England.  The rapid pres rises, enhanced mixing within the cold advection and moderate LLJ near 40 kt will lead to breezy W-NW flow through the day, with gusts 25-35 mph likely at times. This, combined with the very cold ambient temps are likely to keep wind chill values in the 20s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... Highlights...  * Blustery and unseasonably cold Fri night into Sat * Moderating temps Sunday * A coastal storm may impact SNE sometime Mon/Tue, but low confidence  Overview...  Unseasonably cold airmass to start the period, then polar vortex across SE Canada will lift northward into the higher latitudes of the northern Atlantic while anomalous trough reloads in eastern Pacific. Result will be a gradual moderation in temps through the weekend into early next week. Quiet weather through the weekend with high pres in control, then model differences emerge in the timing and amplitude of Pacific shortwave energy which approaches the region early next week. This will impact the track/intensity of a potential coastal low off the east coast.  Friday night into Sunday...  Unseasonably cold airmass with gusty NW winds Fri night gradually diminishing Sat into Sun as high pres builds into the region. Enough wind Fri night to limit the degree of cooling and leaned a bit a milder than the very cold MOS guidance, but still up to 20 degrees below normal. Wind chills falling into single numbers, and near zero over higher terrain which is quite impressive for early to mid November. Temps recover into the mid/upper 30s Sat with another cold night Sat night although with light winds, then temps Sunday about 5- 10 degrees warmer than Sat.  Monday through Wednesday...  Details of a possible coastal storm remain uncertain at this time range and so forecast confidence is low. Consensus of the guidance indicate an offshore track and glancing blow sometime Mon/Tue with improving conditions Wed, but this will depend on the eventual evolution of this trough which will impact timing and track of coastal low pres.

An arctic front may trigger a few rain or snow showers this evening, then blustery and unseasonably cold weather follows Friday into Saturday. A coastal storm may impact the region early next week but confidence is low.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/... Mainly SKC conditions have led to some of the coldest temperatures thus far across S New England given very good setup for radiational cooling. These same radiational processes have also led to some isolated patchy fog across the valleys of W MA/CT which may require an SPS before the morning is out. Meanwhile across coastal MA/RI, it appears that temps will or have already dropped enough within the freeze warnings to likely end the growing season, but these will be finalized later today. Otherwise, frost advisories are being cancelled as the early overnight cloud cover has limited the temp decrease, and will require further freeze/frost headlines down the road.  Otherwise, outside of the fog/low clouds across the Cape/Islands, plenty of sunshine to start the morning until modest moisture loading through the sounding occurs during the day under the development of return flow. This will allow for increasing clouds through the day ahead of a cold front as well as secondary low pres development S of the Delmarva late. Temps today still seasonably cool, mainly in the 40s thanks to H92 temps topping out around +2C. Otherwise, a generally quiet day as weak ridging/high pres shifts E.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 PM THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 PM FRIDAY/... Tonight... Deepening and sharpening upper lvl wave with attendant strong cold front will approach late this evening and cross during the early overnight hours, clearing the region by early AM on Fri. Do agree with previous forecaster, that strongest PVA/low-mid lvl baroclinicity is to the N, mainly across central/N New England and Canada. However, noting a modest increase in low lvl moisture per latest bufkit soundings, which combined with even moderate f-gen with the frontal passage should yield some showery precip to develop through the evening hours, mainly through about midnight local. Will continue to highlight low chance POPs with this frontal passage in spite over the overall lack of moisture. Pre-front, the increase in low lvl moisture will yield sfc dwpts in the mid 30s to near 40, with wet-bulb temps generally above 0C through about 50-100mb above the sfc. Therefore, expecting mainly a cool SHRA initially. On the back side, any ana-frontal showers could transition as strong cold advection develops yielding a quick sfc instability burst, but qpf would be light, suggesting accums would be light as well. The best chance for accumulating precip will be mainly in the E slopes of the Berkshires, where a slight upslope component out of the W behind the front could allow for some early AM SHSN.  Winds behind the front will also increase rapidly through the early morning hours. THe strong cold advection will allow for mixing of at least a percentage of the 40-45 kt LLJ at H85. Rapid wind shifts/strong gusts could occur with the actual frontal passage, while gusts settle back to just below wind advisory across the region, but still blustery. The only caveat is the higher terrain, particularly the Berkshires as mixing will be maximized here. Will be issuing a wind advisory for the E slopes late tonight into Fri morning. Later shifts may need to monitor for a possible expansion. Overnight mins drop into the 30s, but late, mainly in the early AM hours following the front.  Fri... Strong nearly 1040hPa high pres noses in from the Great Lakes following the frontal passage. Cold advection continues most of the day and will likely counteract diurnal warming. Non-diurnal temp trend expected, with highs possibly occurring early, or with nearly stationary temps through the day, holding in the upper 20s to upper 30s most of S New England.  The rapid pres rises, enhanced mixing within the cold advection and moderate LLJ near 40 kt will lead to breezy W-NW flow through the day, with gusts 25-35 mph likely at times. This, combined with the very cold ambient temps are likely to keep wind chill values in the 20s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... Highlights...  * Blustery and unseasonably cold Fri night into Sat * Moderating temps Sunday * A coastal storm may impact SNE sometime Mon/Tue, but low confidence  Overview...  Unseasonably cold airmass to start the period, then polar vortex across SE Canada will lift northward into the higher latitudes of the northern Atlantic while anomalous trough reloads in eastern Pacific. Result will be a gradual moderation in temps through the weekend into early next week. Quiet weather through the weekend with high pres in control, then model differences emerge in the timing and amplitude of Pacific shortwave energy which approaches the region early next week. This will impact the track/intensity of a potential coastal low off the east coast.  Friday night into Sunday...  Unseasonably cold airmass with gusty NW winds Fri night gradually diminishing Sat into Sun as high pres builds into the region. Enough wind Fri night to limit the degree of cooling and leaned a bit a milder than the very cold MOS guidance, but still up to 20 degrees below normal. Wind chills falling into single numbers, and near zero over higher terrain which is quite impressive for early to mid November. Temps recover into the mid/upper 30s Sat with another cold night Sat night although with light winds, then temps Sunday about 5- 10 degrees warmer than Sat.  Monday through Wednesday...  Details of a possible coastal storm remain uncertain at this time range and so forecast confidence is low. Consensus of the guidance indicate an offshore track and glancing blow sometime Mon/Tue with improving conditions Wed, but this will depend on the eventual evolution of this trough which will impact timing and track of coastal low pres. With high pres to the north, it appears there would be enough residual cold air for some interior snow if moisture made it into the region.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...  Highlights...  * Much colder and coldest temperatures so far this season   expected Friday into the weekend with a winter feel * Chance for precipitation late Sunday into Monday but low confidence  Overview and model preferences... Noting continued good agreement between both operational and ensemble guidance suites through the long term with the 08.00Z update. Zonal flow remains dominant through the period, but with influence from the N stream, something that has been lacking much of the fall. The first push is the coldest thus far, with origins in the Yukon and NW Territories, where a snowpack has been established, and will bring about a taste of winter-like cold Fri into early in the weekend. The acute/depth of this trof allows modest ridging to follow, but with little influence of the S stream, temps are likely to remain seasonably cool. This until a second, weaker, open wave arrives early next week. Given the agreement mentioned above, will continue with a consensus blend for the baseline of this long term forecast update.  Details...  Thu night... Strong cold front, associated with a sharpening (and even potentially developing cutoff) trof slides quickly through S New England. Although moisture flux is minimal, a weak spike in PWATs combined with very strong baroclinicity suggest some shower precip development. Mix of SHRA mixing with SHSN likely, with even modest SN accums in the higher terrain and where dynamic cooling under heavier SN/strong lift. Low moisture suggests low QPF though so SN accums should generally remain around a half inch or less especially given sfc temps are still near or above freezing. Temps in the upper 20s to mid 30s as the cold air lags the fropa into the morning. Given strong winds aloft and modest near sfc instability with the cold advection, will also need to monitor for a few squalls.  Fri and Fri night... Post frontal airmass is 2-3 std deviations colder than normal at both H92 and H85. H92 temps drop to -10C to -12C while H85 drop to -14C to -16C. Given the strong cold advection following the cold FROPA, BL mixing is likely to reach near H85. However, given the cold at this level, daytime highs are likely to struggle to break out of the 30s, with a only a few spots in the low 40s given a W component to the flow. Speaking of the flow, strong pres rises nearly 5mb/3hr combined with mixing to a 40-45kt LLJ suggest breezy conditions. Therefore, winds could gust 25-35 mph at times through the day, leading to wind chills in the upper teens and low 20s. Overnight mins will be dependent on how quickly the sfc gradient can slacken, but expecting lows in low teens in the normally colder valleys if interior MA/CT with 20s elsewhere.

The evidence is within the 12z morning sounding. The overnight meso-low now pushed offshore has allowed a NE flow along the backside dragging S colder air over the warmer ocean waters and subsequently yielded steep lapse rates up to H85. The boundary layer continued moist as it has been trapped by an inversion up around H8, seeing a combination of low clouds and drizzle this morning, some lower visibility as a result, over southeast MA mainly. Drier air working its way S with the H925-7 VWPs, already clearing fairly well with the N flow over the E coast of New England, and as the prior forecaster noted, within low to mid level water vapor bands.

Noting continued good agreement between both operational and ensemble guidance suites through the long term with the 08.00Z update. Zonal flow remains dominant through the period, but with influence from the N stream, something that has been lacking much of the fall. The first push is the coldest thus far, with origins in the Yukon and NW Territories, where a snowpack has been established, and will bring about a taste of winter-like cold Fri into early in the weekend. The acute/depth of this trof allows modest ridging to follow, but with little influence of the S stream, temps are likely to remain seasonably cool.

Details...  Thu night... Strong cold front, associated with a sharpening (and even potentially developing cutoff) trof slides quickly through S New England. Although moisture flux is minimal, a weak spike in PWATs combined with very strong baroclinicity suggest some shower precip development. Mix of SHRA mixing with SHSN likely, with even modest SN accums in the higher terrain and where dynamic cooling under heavier SN/strong lift.

Temps in the upper 20s to mid 30s as the cold air lags the fropa into the morning. Given strong winds aloft and modest near sfc instability with the cold advection, will also need to monitor for a few squalls.  Fri and Fri night... Post frontal airmass is 2-3 std deviations colder than normal at both H92 and H85. H92 temps drop to -10C to -12C while H85 drop to -14C to -16C. Given the strong cold advection following the cold FROPA, BL mixing is likely to reach near H85. However, given the cold at this level, daytime highs are likely to struggle to break out of the 30s, with a only a few spots in the low 40s given a W component to the flow. Speaking of the flow, strong pres rises nearly 5mb/3hr combined with mixing to a 40-45kt LLJ suggest breezy conditions. Therefore, winds could gust 25-35 mph at times through the day, leading to wind chills in the upper teens and low 20s.

Despite appearance of precipitation on radar, this morning`s 12Z sounding reflected very dry mid-upper levels that will likely take some time to saturate. The dry air mass is further reflected in the surface fields with dew point spreads close to 10-15 degrees, while surface obs also confirm precipitation is largely not yet reaching the ground. Precipitation chances will gradually increase from west to east tonight as temperatures cool and top-down saturation continues, with the greatest chance closer to the coast. Precipitation type will primarily be a cold rain, though there is potential for temperatures to wet- bulb to near freezing across northwestern Mass prior to the system pulling away. As such, a few hours of a snow/rain mix and minimal accumulations will be possible overnight. As the system moves farther east, cooler and drier air will advect southward, with precipitation ending across most of the area with the exception of the Mass and Rhode Island coasts.",

A cold front will approach by evening, and although there will be little moisture, a brief return of low-level moisture may be supportive of a brief passing shower or light drizzle overnight.  Following the frontal passage, strong cold advection follows with gusty winds and the coldest air mass of the season so far settling across the area. Highs will only reach into the 30s for most areas, with 40s closer to the coast. Cold temperatures will continue into Friday night, with a hard freeze expected even at the coast as temperatures plummet into the teens to the upper 20s.  Dry conditions will continue into Saturday and much of Sunday as high pressure builds across the area, though with temperatures subtly increasing each day as the air mass begins to moderate.  Thereafter confidence decreases as the southern stream jet begins to shift northward. Precipitation chances late Sunday into Monday depend largely on the phasing of two embedded short wave troughs. The developing system will need to be monitored. By Monday or Monday night, the system will begin to move eastward, with high pressure and drier conditions by mid week.",

    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/... Tonight...  Models indicate Great Lakes trough sharpening a bit as it approaches New Eng. This combined with a coupled upper jet structure will result in coastal low strengthening as it tracks well south of New Eng. Despite a track south of the benchmark, deep moisture extends well to the north into SNE as the upstream amplifying mid level trough backs the flow. The uncertainty in the forecast is the northern extent of the precip shield and QPF amounts. NAM is furthest north and wettest but appears to over-amplify the trof so we leaned toward a non NAM model blend. This suggests a period of rain south of the Mass Pike and especially near the south coast tonight, but lower confidence on precip to the north. As the column is cooling, rain could change to a period of snow along the northern extent of the precip shield if it makes it into interior MA.

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... Highlights...  * Dry with seasonable temperatures Wednesday into Thursday * Much colder and coldest temperatures so far this season   expected Friday into the weekend with a winter feel * Chance for precipitation late Sunday into Monday but low confidence  Overview and model preferences... As previous forecaster noted, the extended period is generally N stream dominated and fairly zonal as subtropical high pres shifts generally S of the CONUS, forming a mean W-E jet across the region. That of course does not mean that there are not some shortwave perturbations, the primary of which arrives late week. This deep wave has origins where snowpack is currently established, near Yukon and Northwest Territories, and will bring in the coldest airmass of the season. In spite of this forming in a poorly sampled location, guidance is in fairly good agreement with its depth and acuteness as it dives into the NE. Therefore, will adjust the forecast with a baseline consensus blend of extended guidance.  Details...  Wed night into Thu... Seasonable WX follows the offshore frontal wave passage early Wed as high pres settles over S New England. Dry conditions result. H92 temps hover between 0C and +3C which suggest mainly seasonable temps as lows drop into the low to mid 30s (a few spots in the upper 20s in typically good radiating valleys) and highs in the low-mid 50s.  Thu night into Fri night... Conditions lining up for the coldest 24-48 hour period so far this season. Cold front Thu night arrives with little moisture, but very strong low-mid lvl baroclinicity suggesting decent ascent. Therefore, agree that a few SHRA/SHSN possible particularly in W MA/CT with SN most likely in the higher terrain. Given the front is moisture starved, QPF and snowfall would be very light. By Fri AM, strong CAA is expected, combined with strong pres rises exceeding 1mb/hr. The cold advection could lead to BL mixing reaching nearly H85, tapping some of a 40-45 kt LLJ, which given the pres changes will yield brisk W-NW flow with gusts 25-35 mph at times. H92 and H85 temps are nearly 3 std deviations below normal within this airmass, with H92 temps only reaching as warm as -10C to -12C. This suggests highs mainly in the 30s on Fri, which combined with the breezy conditions yields wind chills in the teens and low-mid 20s. Ambient highs are near the record coldest high temps for Nov 10 (see climate section below). A slight weakening in the pres gradient, should lead to lows in the teens and low 20s, with a few spots potentially approaching single digits. Will follow previous forecaster and lean on coldest guidance, which in this update is the baseline raw 2m temps. Overall, a taste of winter expected late week.  Sat and Sun... Modest ridging follows the deep trof/anomalous airmass into the weekend. Some spit in guidance as the GFS is fastest in bringing a weak clipper through by Sun while ECMWF and several GEFS/EPS ensemble members are slower. Will dismiss the GFS with this run due to it being an early outlier. This suggests a mainly dry weekend with gradually warming ambient temps under high pres. H92 temps -3C to -2C Sat warm to 0C to +2C by Sun. While this is warmer than Fri, the resulting highs (mainly mid 30s to low 40s Sat and low 40s to near 50 Sun) are still below seasonal normals. With a high pres cresting over the region, overnight mins will be subject to good radiational cooling processes. Mins in the 20s to near the freezing mark (if not even colder in spots) are expected. The biggest caveat to the dry forecast will be the Cape/Islands as winds shift to the N-NW allowing for a longer fetch. H85 temps near -4C to -6C and SSTs between 12C and 15C lead to delta-T values near 20C, enough to develop some ocean effect clouds/showers.  Early next week... Low confidence forecast as secondary wave moves E but within mean jet undergoing gradual difluence over the E coast and W Atlantic. While there is some indication for another weak sfc low pres which could impact the region, timing and ultimate impacts are uncertain given significant disagreements in mass/thermal fields under the weakening jet.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/... Highlights...  * Dry with seasonable temperatures Wednesday into Thursday * Much colder and coldest temperatures so far this season   expected Friday into the weekend with a winter feel * Chance for precipitation late Sunday into Monday but low confidence  Discussion...  Main issue for this forecast period is the anticipated arctic outbreak for our area at the end of the week into the weekend. Although this should be a relatively brief incursion, it will seem very dramatic given the mild fall we have had thus far.  Although mid tropospheric flow during this time period is relatively zonal, there will be enough perturbation in the flow to open the door to our first arctic air intrusion of the season. The arctic front appears sharp enough to warrant low chance POPs across at least NW MA and slight chance elsewhere. This system is expected to be moisture starved, but experience has shown fronts with such sharp gradients to be capable of at least scattered brief showers. Any precipitation may be in the form of snow or rain changing to snow across the higher terrain of northern and western MA. Localized trace to a few tenths of snow across the northern Berkshires would not be out of the question.  We have high confidence of a dramatic temperature change. Given the mild temperatures for most of this fall, temperatures this Friday and Saturday, especially combined with the wind on Friday, may come as a shock to many. Given the anomalous nature of the arctic air intrusion, will probably hedge on the cold side of the guidance. The combination of cold temperatures and impressive winds mixing to surface in cold advection pattern will yield significant wind chills. Operational runs bring -12C to -16C 850 mb temperatures give or take a couple of degrees C to southern New England on Friday morning. It is possible that we may not be too far off from record low maxes for some locations. Surface high will likely pass across or near New England during Saturday and yield light winds and a slowly moderating air mass. Even so, temperatures on Saturday will likely be around 15 degrees below normal.  Dry conditions are expected Friday into at least Sunday morning except both the 12Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF depict a band of low level moisture in a NNW to N flow late Friday night into Saturday morning. With large surface-850 mb temperature differentials, it is not out of the question that the outer Cape may be vulnerable to some ocean effect showers early Saturday. For now, will hint this with slight chance POPs across the outer Cape. Because the water temperatures are so warm, any precipitation will probably fall as rain at the surface.  As one might expect in the day 6 to 7 time range, there is divergence in model output as medium range models struggle to resolve short wave energy in this time frame. All medium models depict short wave energy aloft approaching the eastern USA early in the week, but wide variations in timing.

Dry weather but much cooler temperatures will be ushered into the region tonight and Tuesday behind the cold front. Low pressure passing south of the region will bring a chance of showers along the south coast. Wednesday and Thursday. The air then turns colder Friday into early Sunday. Next best chance of wet weather late Sunday into Monday.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /THROUGH TONIGHT/...  This afternoon...  By early afternoon, the cold front was along the Western Mass border. Radar showed a band of showers extending from NH across Western Mass and Western CT. The showers were moving northeast.  Expect these showers to move across Southern New England through the afternoon. The cold front crosses Western Mass and Western CT by midafternoon, then across Eastern Mass and RI during the evening/early night. Thunder isn`t out of the question, but conditions are marginal at best.  Tonight...  With the cold front moving off to the east, winds behind the cold front will come from the northwest and eventually from the north. Could be gusts to 20 knots early in the night, but this should diminish overnight as the pressure gradient gets less.  Dew points in the upper 50s and lower 60s will quickly fall. Observed values in Western NY and in Ontario are in the 30s, so expect similar values into Southern New England during the night. This means dry air, and it means minimum sfc temps in the 30s inland and 40s along the coast.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...  Tuesday...  High pressure across the plains will extend across build across Northern New England. This will bring dry weather Tuesday, but with a weak east surface airflow off the ocean. Temps at 925 mb would support max temps in the upper 40s and around 50. The onshore flow off water temps in the mid 50s may allow eastern areas to reach the lower 50s.  Mid and high level moisture increase during the afternoon and evening. This suggests increasing mid and high clouds at that time, but dry air at lower levels suggests no precip.  Tuesday night...  The current cold front will stall south of New England. The first of two weak shortwaves will move east across the country and induce a low pressure wave along the front. Expect showers over the waters south of New England, and the zonal upper flow should push most of that out to sea. However, Southern New England is in between two jets...right entrance region of the northern jet to our north and left exit region of a southern jet to our south. This may support some northward spread of the rain area, such that southern parts of our area may have a chance of showers. Our pops will follow this trail of thought with slight chance pops to the Mass Pike and chance pops across CT, RI and SE Mass.",

N Pacific wave breaks transition downstream into the near-zonal flow pattern stretched E across the CONUS into the N Atlantic. Initial amplified ridge over the Canadian Rockies yields strong equatorward transport of N-stream energy and Arctic air S. It isn`t until the complete breakdown of the wave break with an offshore NW CONUS cut- off low shearing into the zonal flow that equatorward transport relaxes and westerlies prevail. Midweek mid-upper level confluence over the NE CONUS evolves into strong troughing by the end of the week as a N-stream vortex digs through the base of an attendant trof becoming negatively-tilted downstream over SE Canada, a subsequent strong punch of Arctic air to the rear, limited in its S extent by flow becoming more W with an influence of weak upstream ridging and the fact that the airmass is moderating over above-average surface conditions and bare ground as it sweeps S. Rain chances limited throughout, the best chance still expected Sunday into Monday.  */ Discussion...  Midweek...  Leaning a drier forecast beneath mid to upper level confluence. The cold front and offshore baroclinic zone well offshore along which weak mid-level impulses through the near-zonal flow act upon that yield areas of low pressure. Collocation of stronger QG-forcing S of New England. Acting upon the anti-cyclonic branch of the warm-moist conveyor belt (WCB) off the SE CONUS, considering under-cutting drier air from the N/W associated with high pressure over the interior NE CONUS, can`t rule out some shower activity Thursday into Thursday night especially S/E with the draw back of the WCB beneath lower heights / approaching trof / sweeping cold front with present frontogenetical lift. But thinking outcomes from a mid to high deck, potentially eroding into dry air driving in from the N as discerned from BUFKIT soundings. Light outcomes. Will go with chance PoPs.  Late week...  Cold punch anticipated. Arctic air transitioning S however not with considerable depth given flow becoming westerly. Airmass moderation with progression S, not leaning towards extremes but definitely at temperatures that are near or slightly below seasonable. The reality of widespread 20s Saturday morning and Sunday morning are not out of the question given the magnitude of cold air advection behind both deeper cyclonic turning and cyclogenesis over SE Canada. Anticipate a strong NW gradient / isallobaric response to be the driver.  Early next week...  Downstream flow progressive, we shouldn`t hang beneath the cold air for long. Quick moderation followed by additional energy through the near-zonal flow across the CONUS. Pacific energy transitioning E drawing N sub-tropical air with a measure of lift and forcing, our next best chance of wet weather emerges late Sunday into Monday.",

Batch of showers with locally heavy rainfall across portions of southeast MA was associated with burst of elevated instability/forcing. This activity will continue to lift northeast and the bulk of it will probably be out of the area by midnight.  As for the rest of the overnight hours, a warm front lifting northward coupled with a decent low level jet will result in a few showers from time to time. However, the strongest forcing will remain to our west so the majority of the night will feature dry weather in a given location. Some patchy fog also expected, but there probably will be enough wind in the boundary layer to prevent widespread dense fog except perhaps across portions of the higher terrain.

Monday...  Monday will be unseasonably warm with 850 mb temperatures near 10C. Clouds will probably temper the temperatures some with highs generally in the upper 60s to near 70. Any breaks in the clouds, however, could send temperatures soaring easily through the lower 70s.  The approaching cold front will provide a focus for showers on Monday, mainly during the afternoon and into the evening across the southeast zones. Anticipate QPF generally a quarter to perhaps half an inch. Confident enough of at least measurable rainfall to have a period of POPs in the categorical range for most locations. There is enough elevated instability to support isolated thunderstorms.  Monday night...Showers should end by late evening across the Cape and Islands as the cold front progresses offshore. Much cooler and drier air will filter into the region behind the cold front. Anticipate that surface temperatures will drop fairly quickly Monday night into the 30s and lower 40s by daybreak Tuesday even with some low level mixing with a northerly gradient.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/... Big Picture...  Longwave pattern starts with a trough in the west and ridge east, but migrates to a more zonal pattern during the week. Even so, Hudsons Bay upper low maintains some hint of cyclonic flow in this pattern over the eastern USA through next weekend.  Shortwave pattern shows a shortwave racing through the zonal flow across New England Wednesday. A more significant shortwave circles the Hudsons Bay upper low midweek and sweeps across New England late week. Countour heights are near or above normal much of the week, then lower by the weekend. Closed low over the Gulf of Alaska races east across the Northern USA to the Great Lakes by the weekend.  The GFS and ECMWF mass and thermal fields are in good agreement through Thursday, then show differences in detail Friday and the weekend. Confidence is improved although still some question marks about next weekend.  Details...  Tuesday through Thursday...  The near zonal flow suggests our incoming weather would be more controlled by the Plains high pressure than by any coastal system. This supports a dry forecast with periodic clouds, especially Wednesday as the upper shortwave races through. Temperatures in such a pattern should be near normal.  Mixed layer reaches roughly 925 mb each day. Temperatures at that level support max sfc temps in the 50s. Dew points in the mid 20s to near 40 during this time. Clouds will keep Tuesday night min temps a little warmer that this, then clearing Wed night and Thurs night should allow min temps near dew point in many spots.  Friday through Sunday...  Cold front sweeps through New England Friday, with winds turning from the north behind the front.  High pressure from Northern Ontario builds over New England for the weekend and brings a noticeably colder air mass. Temps in the mixed layer would support max temps in the 30s Saturday while temps just above might support 40 to 45. Guidance is trending toward the latter.  The high will shift east of us later in the weekend, with surface winds shifting around out of the east. This flow will be milder than the Canadian flow, suggesting higher Sunday temperatures. May also see increasing clouds at this time. We will mention chance pops mainly for showers Sunday night well out ahead of this next system, but actual timing may be different.",

Additional showers over New York are mostly headed for VT, but some may spread into Southern New England during the night.  Existing MVFR conditions in Central and Western sections will lower to IFR in most areas during the night as warmer more humid air moves in from the south. Anticipate areas of fog to expand tonight with widespread 3 to 5 miles visibility but some areas of LIFR visibilities, mainly across the higher terrain due to moist upslope flow. Scattered showers will move across the area tonight.  Monday...IFR conditions across most of the area in the morning will gradually improve to widespread MVFR ceilings and pockets of lingering IFR ceilings. Scattered showers ahead of a cold front will reduce visibilities for a couple hours or so, mainly between 3 and 5 miles. Isolated thunderstorms are anticipated.

Milder temperatures return on Monday along with a round of showers and perhaps widely scattered thunderstorms mainly during the afternoon. The forecast calls for mostly dry, seasonable conditions for the remainder of the week. There is a threat for a brush with arctic air late week into the weekend. Next best chance of wet weather will be early the following week.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING/...  1 PM Update...  Forecast is more or less on track. Will remain mostly cloudy throughout the forecast area with some patchy fog along the east slopes of the Berkshires and the Connecitut River Valley north of Springfield. Anticipate the threat of widely scattered showers to increase after about mid afternoon, mainly across northern CT and western MA. We are in a relatively warm air mass, but clouds will temper temperatures some.  1015 AM Update...  Clouds have lowered a little more than the prior forecast NW of a BOS-PVD line, but the sky cover has just been tweaked a little to stay abreast of current observations. Temperatures were nudged slightly up in a few areas to match current trends. Lowered POPs a little, especially across eastern sections except for the Islands south where they were nudged up a little to reflect current radar trends. Nudged winds a bit higher along the coast per recent observations. The onshore flow along the MA east coast may result in a modest .3 to .5 foot surge, possibly just enough for isolated pockets of very minor flooding given the high spring astronomical tide. Will monitor but at this point don`t think this rises even to the level of a statement. All in all, changes to the forecast are minor with the overall trends from the prior forecast looking good.  7 am update...  Spot showers and cloudy weather the main theme today. Weak isentropic ascent mainly on the 290-300K surfaces, but also warm advection lending to rising heights across the region. This parent with the obvious low-level dry air discerned from the 0z upper-air soundings out of Portland, ME and Chatham, MA though above which lapse rates are fairly steep.  While water vapor satellite and latest RAP model data shows a very weak trof with an attendant vortmax sweeping our region, the overall lift and forcing is quite robust, notably over the S waters. Think this is subsequent of boundary layer moistening lending to a deeper, steep lapse rate profile at the base of which the weak isentropic ascent meets up with the forcing along the leading edge of the vortmax. Has sort of a MCV appearance.  But continuing to run into drier air E associated with a ridge of high pressure building SW out of SE Canada, as heights rise across the region associated with warm air advection aloft, expect shower activity to diminish into today, spotty, while remaining cloudy overall with a S flow, keeping conditions mild, highs into the 50s, low 60s along the S-shore. Warmer air kept at bay from the kinked warm front as weak cold air advection occurs along the E slopes of higher terrain. An E wind from the departing high pressure. Winds turning more S, should see the surface warm front approach towards evening, continuing to lift N overnight. Thus temperatures warming through the day, stable or continuing to warm into evening beneath a persistent deck of clouds, lowering with the approach of the warm front.",

Tonight...  The warm front will lift north across the region tonight. This will allow for steady or slowly rising temps into the upper 50s to lower 60s through daybreak Monday. Increasing low level moisture will result in low clouds, but appears there will be enough wind in the boundary layer to keep any widespread fog confined to the interior high terrain. A few spot showers will remain possible in the warm air advection pattern, but given that deeper moisture/forcing will remain to our west the vast majority of the night will be dry in a given location.  Monday and Monday night...  An unseasonably mild day is on tap for Monday despite an abundance of cloudiness. 850T exceeding +10C and southwest flow ahead of a cold front should allow high temps to reach into the upper 60s to the lower 70s in many locations. Do expect a 3 to 5 hour period of showers to accompany a cold front focused Monday afternoon into the first part of the evening. Some marginal elevated instability may result in a rumble or two of thunder. Much cooler air will work in behind the cold front Monday evening behind the cold front. Low temps by daybreak Tuesday should mainly be in the 30s to the lower 40s.",

Zonal flow pattern with little in any way of storm development, over- all conditions near-seasonable. Teleconnections signaling as such. Highs typical this time of year around the 50s, lows around the 30s.  Persistent wave breaks from the Bering Straight into the NE Pacific. A series of impulses ejecting E, becoming stretched within the zonal flow out across the Atlantic (noting the near-neutral NAO/AO). Are watching separate impulses and attendant jet streaks towards the end of the week that remain disconnected, however uncertain as to the N- stream amplifying, ushering Arctic air across the region Friday into Saturday. Like to lean flatter features, especially with a trough disturbance coming ashore along the W CONUS, an advance SW warm flow ushering height rises up against concurrent N-stream troughing. A battle of airmasses setting up over the NE CONUS subsequently, with perhaps deeper troughing earlier advertised now taking place later and downstream. Aside, leaning towards advertising a cold punch of Arctic air aloft Friday into Saturday, just not leaning towards an extreme. Airmass is surely going to moderate as is sweeps S/E over bare ground, areas which have been above-average temperature-wise as of late. At lowest, highs in the 40s Friday and Saturday, lows in the 20s more widespread Friday night into Saturday morning with 30s along the coast. Coastal zones, still considered in the growing season, under threat of seeing frost over much of the week.  The aforementioned impulse above over the W CONUS sweeping the area into early next week, our next best chance of wet weather. Again, watching upstream trends, wave breaks transitioning, held up against the Rockies, shearing downstream. Should ridging amplify downstream over the Central Plains into Canada, deeper troughing and N-stream influences would become more prominent over the NE CONUS, yet how- ever leaning more flat-flow features given the absence of blocking over the N Atlantic, an open, progressive flow overall. GEFS plumes show clearly by the weekend the considerable amount of spread in ensemble members, the uncertainty in the forecast beginning Friday.",

Believe VFR conditions will prevail through the afternoon SE of a BOS-PVD line and mainly MVFR ceilings to the NW of the BOS-PVD line. An area of fog has shown up in observations and web cams across the east slopes of the Berkshires. This may spread into the CT River Valley, mainly north of CEF.  Anticipate ceilings lowering to IFR or low MVFR tonight in most areas. Model guidance suggests areas of LIFR ceilings developing late tonight in the soupy air mass behind the warm front. Anticipate areas of fog developing as well, although there may be enough of a low level wind gradient to prevent LIFR visibilities except over higher terrain, where the upslope of higher dewpoint air is likely to result in denser fog. Widely scattered showers are anticipated tonight as well, mainly across the NW half of the forecast area.  Monday and Monday night...Moderate confidence. IFR-VLIFR lifting during the morning to a mix of low-end VFR to MVFR, slowest along the high terrain. Winds becoming SW. Gusts to 25 kts, especially along the coastal plain. Band of SHRA with widely sct tstms may impact terminals during the afternoon. Improving conditions W to E Monday night.  KBOS Terminal...Only moderate confidence since BOS is on the edge of the MVFR ceilings. Could see occasional, temporary lifting of the MVFR cloud deck and thus the reason for the TEMPO group in the TAF. Ceilings are expected to lower tonight to probably IFR or at least low MVFR levels. Cannot rule out a period or two of LIFR ceilings during the early morning hours but does not seem likely with a S to SW surface wind direction.  KBDL Terminal...Moderate confidence. Believe light NW wind will eventually shift to S later tonight after warm frontal passage. MVFR ceiling will likely persist through the afternoon and possibly lower to IFR late tonight.

Warmer temperatures return on Monday along with showers and isolated thunderstorms moving into the region as a cold front approaches. The front moves to the south Monday night followed by mainly dry and seasonably cool weather for the rest of the week. However, a coastal storm will be lurking to the south Thursday and there is uncertainty on the potential for an arctic blast on Friday.",
    "near_term": ".NEAR TERM /UNTIL 6 AM SUNDAY MORNING/...  945 pm update...  Previous forecast on track with an abundance of mid/high level cloudiness that will continue to impact the region overnight. Winds will be light enough though for low temps to still bottom out mainly in the middle 30s to the lower 40s. An approaching shortwave may bring a few sprinkles/light showers across our western and southern zones near daybreak. Forcing and deeper moisture is quite limited, so anything that impacts our region should be rather light/spotty.",
    "short_term": ".SHORT TERM /6 AM SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/... Sunday... Warm front approaches SNE from the south. Large scale forcing is lacking but deepening moisture and weak low level warm advection will bring a risk of a few showers. Not a washout but a cloudy day expected with a few showers at times, with best chance in the interior. Temps may reach 60 degrees along the south coast by late afternoon, but hold in the 50s elsewhere and possibly close to 50 across higher terrain in northern MA.  Sunday night... Warm front lifts north across SNE with winds shifting to the south. Expect rising temps through the 50s in the interior and lower 60s in the coastal plain. Dewpoints rising as well which will lead to areas of low clouds and patchy fog developing. Still a few showers possible, but as mid level dry air moves up from the south over the abundant low level moisture in place, areas of drizzle may develop.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/... Big Picture...  Longwave pattern holds a ridge over the Gulf of Mexico area with a low near Hudsons Bay. The northern tier of the USA holds a nearly flat flow but reflects a low amplitude cyclonic turn. Heights start the week above climatological normals, but steadily lower through the week.  Mass and thermal fields are similar amongst the various models through Wednesday, but then show serious differences Thursday through Saturday. For example, a southern stream shortwave generates a storm that passes offshore Thursday night. This either turns north and affects us...per the GGEM...or grazes us per the ECMWF or stays offshore. Very cold air either pours in behind this system Friday...per the ECMWF and 06Z GFS...or does not as per the 12Z GFS and the Friday 12Z GFS.  Moderate-high confidence Monday to Wednesday as a shortwave drives through the flow and crosses our area Monday night. High pressure then builds in.  Low confidence at best for the Thursday to Saturday forecast with no consensus model-to-model and run-to-run.  Details...  Monday...  Southern New England will be in the warm sector much of Monday. A south to southwest flow will maintain a mild airmass. Clouds will limit mixing, but even the 950 mb temps at 16C suggest high temps in the upper 60s to low 70s. Dew points start the day near 60 and should linger in the upper 50s and lower 60s most of the day. None of this looks record-level, but still well above normal for the day.  Upper shortwave will drive a cold front through our area Monday afternoon and early night. Morning moisture profiles continue to show a mid-level dry zone over a low level moist layer. So while a shower is possible early, more likely to have clouds and areas of drizzle.  Model jet dynamics show some coupling of low level convergence near the front with upper level venting. So expect a period of showers in the afternoon and early night. Precipitable water values climb through the day, with a max near 1.5 inches just ahead of the cold front and would support locally heavy downpours. Totals 48-50, LI around zero, and a weak theta-e ridge continue to suggest some isolated thunder potential.  After the cold front moves through, expect winds to turn from the north and bring cold advection and drying air for the Monday overnight.  Tuesday-Wednesday...  Cold front moves well offshore. High pressure builds in from the west with drier and seasonably cooler temperatures. Moisture cross sections show some lingering mid and high clouds each day. With an upper shortwave crossing at this time, patchy clouds would be consistent. Models suggest mixing to 925 mb Tuesday and 900 mb Wednesday. Temps at these levels would support max sfc temps in the lower 50s Tuesday and either side of 50 on Wednesday. Meanwhile dew points and light winds would support min temps 25-35 inland and 35- 45 along the coastline.  Thursday through Saturday...  Model problems as noted above. One noticeable difference involves the Hudsons Bay upper low, which is shallow on the GFS and sharper/deeper on the ECMWF. The GGEM sharpens the closed low but also shifts it west into Manitoba. Bottom line... the ECMWF favors cold air into the Northern USA while the other two do not.  Also hard to have confidence when the blend of those models yields 30 percent sky cover and 20-25 percent pops.  We have resorted to manual adjustments to the model blend, limiting slight chance pops to Cape Cod and Islands Thursday night and again Saturday night. We have maintained the late week cooldown but have raised temps 3-5 degrees. We will need to monitor this...and follow the bouncing forecast.",

Even on Sun, not a lot of forcing present to generate showers, although weak low level convergence ahead of warm front may be enough to bring scattered light showers which is typical of SE flow. Certainly better synoptic scale lift and moisture convergence should end up north and west of our area. Doesn`t look like much potential for thunder given stable profiles.

Highlights...  * Mild Sunday PM into Monday prior to a sweeping cold front * Uncertainty for mid-week as SNE is on the edge of the competing   airmasses * Arctic high pressure will spill anomalous cold air into SNE   Friday  Pattern Overview/Confidence...  00z guidance is in agreement for the medium range. However, still some spread in the guidance for late next week. Mid-level ridging across the North Atlantic with approaching trough over the Great Lakes. Cold front associated with the trough will pass through on Monday but becomes stretched and stalls south of the area as upper level flow turns zonal. Approaching shortwave from the Pac NW will move through the Plains developing a low pressure system along the stalled boundary during the Tues/Wed timeframe. Right now this will keep SNE on the dry yet cool side. However, ensembles continue to show some spread in the location of this system. If the boundary trends northward then unsettled weather potential increases, especially as another shortwave pushes through the flow Thursday. Anomalous high pressure over the Great Lakes will build into the region on Friday/Saturday bring a below normal airmass.  Details...  Sunday PM into Monday...High confidence.  Increasing low level moisutre and dewpoints Sunday night thanks to the passage of the warm front. Temps will also warm during the overnight hours. Model cross-sections show saturation through the column so expect sct showers through this time period.  Behind the warm front, temperatures will warm on Monday to well above average. Increasing 925mb temps to 14-15C which could yield highs in the low to mid 70s depending on cloud cover. Could be a period of dry weather during the morning hours ahead of the frontal passage.  Stretched cold front will approach the region from the west on Monday. Increasing PWATs 2 STD above normal combined with increasing LLJ at 925mb could result in widespread showers with some heavy downpours ahead of the front. Could also see a few isolated thunderstorms as surface and elevated instability increases combined with steep lapse rated and 40 kts of 0-6km Bulk Shear. Can`t rule out a strong storm as K values are above 32C with LI and showalter values below 0. Something to keep an eye on in the coming days.  Monday night into Wednesday...Moderate confidence  Cold front will move through the region and stall south of the region. Behind the front, CAA will filter into the region resulting in a cooler airmass for Tuesday and Wednesday. A weak wave will develop along the front to the south late Tuesday/Wednesday. Cannot rule out some precip for the south coast, however if the front pushes closer northward which could bring more widespread precip and warmer temps. If the front goes farther south then cooler temps and dry weather will prevail. Will continue with a slight chc of showers but the trend is for dry weather.  Thursday into Friday...Moderate confidence.  Still some uncertainty in this period as the High pressure builds in from the Great Lakes and stall front remains south of the area. Deterministic guidance keeps the region dry and seasonable. However some ensemble guidance members continue to show a bit more unsettled pattern for this time frame. Will trend towards a blend in the guidance for this time period until models spread decreases.  Increasing confidence in anomalous cold airmass spilling into the region late next week. GEFS indicated near 2 STD below normal at 925mb as Arctic airmass spills into the region. EPS also trend towards temps struggling to reach 40F - which is below average for mid Nov.",

It will feel chilly compared to the past two days, but high temperatures should be right around normal.  This high pressure will be slow to move away from our region Saturday night. However, it will also provide a near ideal overrunning surface as strong warm air advection gets underway. The big question will be how quickly the lower levels can saturate and permit rain to reach the ground. Currently thinking the timing will be a little slower than prior forecasts. The greatest risk for showers will be across central and western MA, as well as northern CT, starting around midnight at the earliest. This timing could change with later forecasts. Low temperatures Saturday night should not be as low as tonight, and also high enough where any precipitation should fall as rain.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... Big Picture...  Upper high pressure remains camped across the Southern USA. Shortwaves race across the northern USA, with general agreement that these cross New England Monday and Wednesday.  Contour heights and thermal are projected above normal on Sunday and Monday, below normal midweek, then trending above normal again by Friday.  Mass and thermal fields are similar through Tuesday, then take a diverging trend Wednesday through Friday. Therefore reduced confidence in the solution starting Wednesday.  Details...  Sunday-Monday...Moderate-High confidence.  Departing high pressure leaves a southeast surface flow over New England Sunday, while the upper flow turns from the southwest. Moisture increases at all levels Sunday, with the change in wind direction inducing convergence and lift over New England. This warm front will bring clouds and a few showers to the region. The strongest low level jet will move up through Northern NY and VT, so the best chance of showers will be to our north.  Warmer air moves in with the front, with dew points in the 50s to near 60. So temperatures Sunday night will not fall too much from daytime highs.  Monday will be a mild day with temps mid 60s to low 70s and dew points lingering near 60. None of this would be record-level, but still well above normal. A cold front swings through during late afternoon or early night. Increasing low level winds, but much of this remains focused to our north. Moisture cross sections show some mid-level drying Sunday night and Monday morning, indicating a break in most showers...but still a chance of drizzle or a few low- topped showers overnight. Precipitable water values then climb to around 1.50 inches, which is well above normal and would support showers and local downpours Monday. Totals 48-50, LI around zero, and a weak theta-e ridge suggest some thunder potential.  Once the cold front moves through, expect drying Monday overnight.  Tuesday...Moderate confidence.  The Monday cold front stalls south of New England Tuesday. The GFS indicates a wave developing along the front and passing to our south but close enough to spread showers into areas south of the Mass Pike. The GGEM and ECMWF do not show this. We will maintain pops less than 15 pct most areas, but 15-24 pct along the south coast and southern waters.  Cold air advection starts Tuesday, although this may be slowed if the low pressure wave develops as per the GFS.  Temps at 850 mb on Tuesday fall about 8C from Monday levels. Temps then fall another 12C by Wednesday. This and mixing depths suggest max temps in the 50s Tuesday and 40s to low 50s Wednesday. Low temps should reach near freezing in spots Tuesday night and more generally Wednesday night.  Wednesday through Friday...Low-moderate confidence.

Overall trend in the forecast remains on track for this morning. Latest obs and webcams show that dense fog and stratus has spilled into southeast MA and into coastal RI. Anticipate these conditions to remain until mixing takes place within the next hour or two. SPS still remains in effect so will hold off on issuing an adv at this time.  Previous Discussion...  Increased mixing should allow for low clouds to burn off some by late morning/early afternoon. While we probably will still be dealing with a scattered to broken deck of cloudiness, should also see peeks of sunshine. This coupled with 850T between +10C and +11C and good mixing out ahead of an approaching cold front will result in an unseasonably mild afternoon. High temps should reach into the lower to middle 70s across much of the region, making it feel more like late September than early November. It will also become a bit breezy with southwest wind gusts of 20 to 25 mph developing this afternoon.  While the vast majority of the day will be dry, a cold front will cross the region during the mid-late afternoon/early evening. The best shortwave energy/forcing will be passing to our north, but still may be enough lift for a brief band of isolated to scattered showers as the front crosses the region.

Strongest of those winds will be near shore with better mixing. Although marginal this afternoon, opted to start small craft advisories for the waters.  Tonight...High confidence. Decent pressure rises behind the cold front and cool advection over the relatively mild ocean should yield widespread northwest wind gusts of 25 to 30 knots. Small craft headlines posted for all waters.  Saturday...High confidence. High pressure noses down from Quebec and winds should drop below small craft thresholds by mid morning across all waters. SCA seas will persist a bit longer across the eastern outer-waters before diminishing by mid afternoon.  Outlook /Saturday Night through Tuesday/...Moderate Confidence.

Cannot rule out a stray sprinkle into this evening, but they should be very few and far between.  Light south to southwest winds will prevail tonight. The main concern will be the potential for low clouds and fog. Current thinking is the most likely places will be the interior river valleys, as this should be more of a radiational scenario than a marine advection fog, although there could be a component of that toward the south coast, too.  Above normal temperatures continue, with overnight lows right around our normal highs for early November.",

    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...  */ Highlights...   - Lifting N warm front with rain Saturday night into Sunday  - Mild Sunday night into Monday prior to a sweeping cold front  - Uncertain forecast into next week  - Overall seasonable, periods of nuisance wet weather  */ Overview...  Fairly tranquil period ahead with periods of nuisance weather. With respect to teleconnections, the MJO relaxed, the PNA / EPO / WPO all largely negative with the AO / NAO near-neutral to positive. Signals altogether of temperatures remaining near-seasonable, nothing that would indicate one direction or the other, cooler or warmer. The door is wide open downstream across the N Atlantic, progressive. Any upstream disturbances, looking fairly weak, are for the most part going to be mid to upper level open waves, the NE CONUS oscillating between airmasses (cP vs. mT/cT), falling beneath the thermal wind transition.  Confident through early Tuesday, thereafter uncertainty prevails. There is disagreement among the ensemble members, larger spread, and feel this has to do with the transition of the wave break over the SW CONUS towards the E, poor handling of features over the N Pacific and Alaska. The 02.0z EC initially had a very pronounced storm for the late week period while the 02.12z is largely absent. Similar volatility is noted with the GEFS sea level pressure trends. Worth watching for now.  So with airmass oscillations, leading warm frontal boundaries (i.e., Sunday) contributing to visibility issues followed by sweeping cold frontal boundaries (i.e., Monday) behind which high pressure out of NW Canada follows. A concern for early November, on the boundary of airmasses, N/W likely cooler and perhaps so much to the 0C wet bulb netting wet snow across high terrain (leaning < 32F for any snow accumulations, light overall). Simply put, periods of nuisance wet weather, no hazards, threats, impacts to discuss other than wearing a few more layers if you`re heading outside. We are getting into late Autumn of course when highs are normally in the 50s and lows in the 30s.",

Shortwave passing to our northwest was inducing enough of a low level jet/marginal elevated instability for brief scattered showers very early this morning. The main focus for these brief showers will be northwest of the Boston to Providence corridor until daybreak.  As for temps, lows have already been reached and most areas will see readings rise into the 50s to lower 60s across RI/SE MA by daybreak. However, as high resolution guidance depicts portions of western MA/northern CT especially the Valley locations will see temps hold in the 40s as inversion will likely not mix out.",

However, subsidence behind departing shortwave and mid level drying moving up from the south may lead to partial sunshine in the afternoon. Warm advection will result in a much milder afternoon as 925 mb temps increase to 13-14C. Clouds will limit full potential but still expect highs to reach well into the 60s with a few places in CT/RI and eastern MA possibly reaching 70. Gusty southerly winds developing in the coastal plain with gusts 20-30 mph, strongest near the south coast.  Thursday night... Next shortwave and attending cold front moves into the eastern Lakes with SNE remaining in a dry SW flow pattern well ahead of the boundary. Increasing dewpoints in the southerly flow will lead to stratus and fog developing overnight. It will be a mild night with lows remaining in the 50s.",
    "long_term": ".LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... Highlights...  * Above normal temperatures expected Friday with scattered   showers across the interior * Spotty showers Saturday night into Sunday ahead of a warm   front * More scattered showers Monday as another front passes * Unsettled conditions may linger through the middle of next   week  Overview/Model Preferences...  12Z model guidance remains in good agreement through most of the long term period. Nearly zonal flow aloft across the northern tier states keeps weather systems moving along. Weak digging H5 trough in fast flow pushes out of the Great Lakes on Friday, but most of energy remains N of the region. Associated cold front should push SE late Friday/Friday evening, bringing a brief surge of cooler air Friday night and Saturday.  Large high pressure passes N of the region this weekend, pushing into the Maritimes by early next week. Milder air briefly returns as warm front pushes north on Monday, followed by another cold front sometime late Mon or Mon night. From Tuesday onward, most models and ensembles continuing to signal progressive flow aloft. Noting widening model solution spread amongst the model suite from Tuesday onward.  Used a blend of available guidance through Monday, then transitioned over to ensemble approach beyond late Monday.  Details...  Friday...High confidence.  As H5 short wave digs across the Great Lakes region, cold front approaches during the day. With the progressive nature of the steering pattern, the mid level system continue to move steadily toward the region, so the cold front should push across late Fri afternoon or Fri evening.  Expect another mild day with readings reach the lower 70s mainly across the CT valley and along the coastal plain, though a bit cooler across the higher inland terrain. Will need to monitor this since there will be quite a few clouds around ahead of the approaching front.  As the front crosses, SW winds will pick up a bit, but will start to get gusty after midnight as winds shift to N Fri night, bringing a surge of cooler air with H85 temps falling to +4C to +6C around or after midnight, along with a tightening pressure gradient with the high to the NE. Short range models all signaling gusty winds, up to 30-35 mph mainly along E coastal areas.  Saturday...High confidence.  Strong cold air advection continues to work across the region Saturday morning and, with good mixing in place, will continue to see gusty N-NE winds through about midday mainly along coastal areas. May see gusts up to 20-30 mph. Expect seasonal temps with highs mainly in the upper 40s to mid 50s, coolest across the higher terrain.  Clouds will increase Sat night as the high moves into the Maritimes. Winds will diminish as they shift to E-SE during the night. Some scattered showers may reach western areas toward daybreak as the stalled front S of the region begins to shift back as a warm front.  Sunday and Monday...Moderate confidence.  The front S of the region will push NE during Sunday. Winds shift to S during the day, then S-SW Sunday night as the front lifts N. Expect showers to increase especially Sunday afternoon and night with a weak mid level disturbance in the flow. Depending upon how quickly the warm front pushes through, along with the possibility of some brief breaks in the clouds, could see temps rise quickly in some locations. For now, have kept high temps mainly in the 50s but could sneak to around 60 along the S coast.  Another cold front slowly progresses eastward out of NY state during Monday as the parent low shifts toward Hudson Bay. Will see best chance for showers through the day, though temps will rise nicely with the continued SW wind flow in place. Should see temps top off in the 60s for most areas. May see gusty SW winds along the S coast, up to 25-30 mph. May see a brief break in the showers during Mon night.  Tuesday and Wednesday...Low to moderate confidence.  As the mid level steering pattern across the northern tier states becomes nearly zonal, will be a tough forecast during this timeframe as it will depend upon where the passing cold front stalls. The front should settle S of the region by early Tuesday, but some models are trying to develop a wave or two of low pres moving along it. This may bring more off and on showers scattered about into mid week.  It appears that the front remains S of the region, so cooler air should start slowly working S. Temps on Tuesday look to be a bit cooler but still topping off just a few degrees above normal, but Wed could be an unsettled and chilly day. Still quite a bit of uncertainty with the temp and precip pattern at this time.",
